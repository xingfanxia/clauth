# Install

Linux, macOS, and Windows (Git Bash / MSYS2). clauth needs `claude` on `PATH` for `clauth start`, `resume`, the MCP `delegate` tool, and the Claude Code plugin's install and self-heal, both of which drive the `claude plugin` CLI. Everything else works without it.

## Cargo

```bash
cargo install clauth
```

Upgrade the same way. A cargo-installed binary is never self-replaced: it reports that a newer release exists and leaves the swap to you.

## Install script

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uwuclxdy/clauth/mommy/install.sh | bash
```

The script uses `cargo` when it finds it. Pass `--nocargo` to force a prebuilt binary instead:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uwuclxdy/clauth/mommy/install.sh | bash -s -- --nocargo
```

The binary lands in `~/.local/bin` (or `/usr/local/bin` when that is writable). The script prints a `PATH` hint when the install dir is not on your `PATH`, and it never edits your shell profile. Uninstall by deleting the binary it names.

## From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/uwuclxdy/clauth
cd clauth
cargo build --release
# binary at ./target/release/clauth
```

## Updates

A binary install checks GitHub for a newer release in the background on launch and replaces itself once every check passes:

1. the release tag is newer than the running build
2. `sha256sums.txt` downloads
3. its minisign signature verifies against a public key compiled into the binary
4. the platform asset's SHA-256 matches that sums file
5. the new binary is written, fsynced, and swapped in atomically

Any failing step skips the update and leaves the running binary alone. The check runs at launch, so turning auto-update off (the Config tab's `auto-update` row, persisted as `[update] auto_update = false` in profiles.toml) takes effect the next time clauth starts. `CLAUTH_NO_UPDATE=1` turns the whole thing off even when the toggle is on. Full chain: [SECURITY.md](https://github.com/uwuclxdy/clauth/blob/mommy/SECURITY.md#auto-update-verification).

## Shell completions

The first TUI launch offers to install completions for your shell. bash and zsh get a `source` line appended to the rc file, asked for with `[Y/n]` first; fish writes straight into `~/.config/fish/completions/`. The answer is remembered in `~/.clauth/.completions_installed`.

Install or refresh them any time:

```bash
clauth completions install          # detects your shell from $SHELL
clauth completions install zsh      # or name it
clauth completions bash             # print the script to stdout instead
```

`CLAUTH_NO_COMPLETIONS=1` skips the first-run prompt entirely.

## Claude Code plugin

The plugin is a separate step, installed from the TUI's Services tab and covered on [Claude Code plugin](Claude-Code-Plugin). Because that install drives the `claude plugin` CLI, it needs a recent `claude`: an older one fails the install naming the version it wants.
