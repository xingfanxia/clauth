# clauth wiki

**Multi-account manager for Claude Code: switch accounts, watch 5h / 7d usage, auto-switch before a limit stops you.**

The [README](https://github.com/uwuclxdy/clauth#readme) is the tour. This wiki is the reference.

## Quick answers

- Settings live in `~/.clauth/profiles.toml` (global), `~/.clauth/codex-profiles.toml` (the codex roster) and `~/.clauth/profiles/<name>/config.toml` (per account). All three are hand-editable.
- Most settings in the Claude Code files are editable in the TUI too: `clauth`, then the Setup / Fallback / Config / Plugin tabs; the codex roster has no tab.
- A switch rewrites `~/.claude/.credentials.json`, parts of `~/.claude/settings.json`, and the stale identity block in `~/.claude.json`. Nothing else in `~/.claude/` moves.
- `clauth start <profile>` runs a session in its own config dir, so it never disturbs the account your global `claude` is on.
- Trust model, network activity, and vulnerability reporting: [SECURITY.md](https://github.com/uwuclxdy/clauth/blob/mommy/SECURITY.md).
