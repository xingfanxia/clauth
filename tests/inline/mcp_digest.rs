//! The since-your-last-call digest, pinned on the traps that make it a
//! feature rather than a no-op:
//!
//! - the baseline is SHARED across server clones (rmcp clones the handler per
//!   request; a per-clone baseline reports nothing forever);
//! - a first call reports nothing (there was no earlier state to compare
//!   against, and claiming "nothing changed" would assert otherwise);
//! - reporting consumes the delta, and a surface that does not report must not
//!   swallow it (the all-scope roster);
//! - `switch_profile` never reports its own write (it reseeds), but an arm
//!   that refused before any mutation reports like the session-scope roster
//!   does;
//! - `monitor` with no `job_ids` returns as soon as something moves, never
//!   sleeps holding the baseline lock;
//! - the usage cache is keyed on the profile it was read from, so a profile
//!   change is never dressed up as a refresh of a file nobody refreshed;
//! - a batch is one call: one digest, top-level, rendered in the prose reply,
//!   and a background `delegate` handle is a batch of one or of N under the
//!   same rule.
//!
//! Replies are prose now (the JSON payload is internal to the renderers), so
//! the digest assertions read the prose clause: "since your last call: ...".
