//! The rank check is the mechanism every other lock-discipline claim leans on.
//!
//! `docs/internals.md` states the global lock order as an executable check
//! rather than prose ("what used to be prose is now an executable check"), and
//! `the_ttl_clock_is_reachable_under_the_config_guard` is written on the premise
//! that a misorder panics there. But the whole enforcement is one
//! `debug_assert!` inside `RankGuard::enter`, and nothing asserted that it
//! actually fires: a refactor that dropped the check, or loosened `>` to `>=`,
//! would compile, keep every lock test green, and silently downgrade the order
//! to prose again — the exact failure the module was built to end.
//!
//! These pin the mechanism itself, both directions. `debug_assertions`-gated
//! because the check compiles out in release, where the guard is a no-op by
//! design (a `--release` test run must not fail for the absence of a panic).
