//! F1 (filed 2026-08-14): a detached background delegate still running when
//! `HomeSandbox` tears down must never touch the operator's REAL `$HOME`.
//! `launch_background_delegate` detaches via `tokio::task::spawn_blocking`
//! with no handle the caller keeps, so nothing joined it before
//! `HOME_OVERRIDE` cleared. `HomeSandbox::drop` now blocks on
//! `testutil::register_background_task`'s completion signal for the same
//! reason it already joins `tui::TEST_WORKERS`.

/// `run_delegate` fails fast at `load_config().find` regardless of which
/// `$HOME` it resolves; only the WRITE LOCATION of the resulting `done` job
/// file differs between the two, which is exactly the leak this test is
