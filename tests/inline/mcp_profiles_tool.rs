//! Guard coverage for the MCP `profiles` tool's response shape.
//!
//! It is the largest single thing clauth puts in front of a model — 3,854 real
//! tokens across one operator's 27 profiles before this trim, against 955 for
//! the whole init block — and its own description tells the model to call it at
//! session start. So the two things keeping it small are worth pinning: the
//! `names` filter, and the fields that appear only when they carry news.
//!
//! The `scope: "session"` arm is the folded-in former `which` tool: it resolves
//! through the same `which::resolve_active` tiers the session itself resolves
//! by, renders its one row through the roster's own `profile_line`, and carries
//! `source`.
