//! TECH-3 — anti-wedge watchdog decision (`watchdog_check`).
//!
//! Pure tests of the abort decision: `on_stall` is injected as a flag so the
//! stall path is asserted without a real `std::process::abort()`. The production
//! wiring (heartbeat store each tick + a thread that calls `abort`) is a thin
//! loop around these predicates.
