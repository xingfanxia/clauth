//! `clauth daemon --dump-openapi` against the real binary: the dump prints the
//! served OpenAPI document, leaves home alone, and a reader that left does not
//! change the run's exit code. Spawning is the only way to see the bytes a
//! shell would capture, the exit code it would get, and that the home dir stays
//! empty — `tests/inline/cli.rs` drives `write_openapi_document` into a buffer,
//! which proves nothing about the dispatch arm that runs first.
//!
//! Unix only, for the reason `tests/closed_reader.rs` gives: the child resolves
//! its home through `$HOME`, which only Unix lets a test point at a sandbox.
