# clauth macOS fork — progress ledger

Branch: `main` (the fork's default; renamed from `feat/macos-keychain` 2026-07-08, off `upstream/mommy`). Fork of `uwuclxdy/clauth`
adding real macOS Keychain account switching, a self-contained browser OAuth
login, and a headless daemon + `status.json` feed for a menu-bar app.

**Core requirement (drives everything):** auto-switch accounts *before* the active
one's 5-hour window blocks a running Claude Code session — unattended, with the
TUI closed. A running `claude` re-reads the Keychain per request, so a Keychain
rewrite switches it mid-session (user-verified). The daemon delivers the
"unattended, TUI closed" half.

## Status by milestone

| Milestone | State | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| **KC** — switch writes the `Claude Code-credentials` Keychain item via `/usr/bin/security` | ✅ done | `src/keychain.rs`; `clauth xfx` switches a running session (user-verified) |
| **Divergence fix** — no false "uncaptured credentials" prompt on every switch | ✅ done | `classify_link_at` compares OAuth token, not symlink identity; also upstream PR #4 |
| **Switch fix** — force-relink so a captured Keychain mirror isn't refused | ✅ done | `actions::switch_profile`; regression test `switch_replaces_active_account_mirror_without_refusing` |
| **OAUTH** — `clauth login` = self-contained browser PKCE login | ✅ done | `src/oauth_login.rs`; upstream's CC-`/login` fails on macOS (see Ground truth) |
| **Daemon R1** — headless scheduler owner + auto-switch execution | ✅ done | `src/daemon/mod.rs`; on-device boot/tick/guard verified |
| **Daemon R2** — `~/.clauth/status.json` serializer | ✅ done | `src/daemon/status_json.rs`; `status --json` shape correct vs real caches |
| **Daemon R4** — `clauthd.sock` (snapshot/switch/refresh) | ✅ done | `src/daemon/socket.rs`; live socket round-trip verified |
| **Daemon R5** — `clauth status --json` single-shot | ✅ done | dispatch arm in `main.rs` |
| **Daemon R6** — launchd LaunchAgent | ✅ done | `dist/macos/com.clauth.daemon.plist` + `daemon-install.sh` |
| **Daemon R3** — TUI↔daemon coordination | ⏸ deferred | see below |
| **Phase S** — `ccsbar` menu-bar app | ✅ built | own repo `~/projects/devtools/ccsbar`; `swift build` clean, launches; S7 (Settings/Sparkle/cask) deferred. **Renamed clauthbar → ccsbar (Claude Code Switcher Bar) 2026-07-06** — repo/dir/module/bundle all `ccsbar`; CBAR-4 milestone codenames kept as historical |
| **CBAR-2** — menu-bar 7d/fable usage + fallback chain/status + inline config | ✅ built | daemon config socket + `fallback_config` primitives + rich ccsbar UI; new commands verified live |
| **CBAR-3** — CodexBar-aesthetic SwiftUI redesign | ✅ built | `MenuBarExtra(.window)` panel replaces `NSMenu`+block-char bars; ccsbar `745dae3`; `swift build` clean, snapshot-verified, relaunched |
| **resetHint fix** — daemon's microsecond `resets_at` timestamps parsed | ✅ fixed | ccsbar `4dfc26a`; "resets in …" hints were silently nil against real data; snapshot mock now regression-guards |
| **CBAR-4 research** — UX research → "Preflight" design → build plan (docs only) | ✅ recorded | `docs/ccsbar/{UX-RESEARCH,CBAR-4-DESIGN,CBAR-4-PLAN}.md`; 3 researchers → 4 proposals → 3 judges → synthesis; 3 live incidents captured incl. Incident C (stale-token switch logs out every running claude → AUTH-1/2 specced) |
| **CBAR-4 build** — "Preflight" inspect-first panel shipped + live-hardened | ✅ built | ccsbar: inspect-first list + detail-card switch + chain rail + inline config (CBAR4-1..7); weekly-reset timer `a1d8fd5`, config Move-up/down reorder `8583229`, switch-latency `49de467` (settle waits for the actual effect) + daemon tick-wake `69cc0c3` (0.92s→0.034s), UX-clarity pass `ec76521` (⚡"watching" chip, switch-discoverability hint, "spent" exhaustion pill). `swift build` clean, 113 tests green, snapshot-verified, running live |
| **TECH audit** — 6-dimension architecture audit → 14-milestone backlog (docs only) | ✅ recorded | `.agent/TECH-PLAN.md` (42 confirmed / 6 refuted findings, adversarially verified); kickoff prompts in `.agent/GOAL-PROMPT.md` |
| **UP-1** — upstream sync: PRs #4/#18/#19 merged by uwuclxdy + follow-ups reconciled | ✅ done | merge `387607f` (2026-07-06): upstream took all 3 PRs, added windows `rundll32` open_url fix, loopback callback security tests, `Some("")` classify guard, TUI login modal (`803840b`/`ca2d248`), burn-aware switching (#8-b), exclusive `last_resort`; fork keeps reauth-existing `clauth login` (upstream parked as #7 follow-up). 667→670 tests, clippy clean |
| **UP-3** — daemon publishes its own forecast in status.json (kills ccsbar mirror drift) | ✅ done | `81c00a2`: upstream's walk-semantics change (exclusive `last_resort` replaced the threshold-100 sink convention + burn-aware active check) silently invalidated ccsbar's line-pinned Swift mirror — semantic flip, green fixture tests, wrong prediction. Fix: additive `forecast{action,to}` + `burn_aware` + per-profile `fallback.last_resort` in status.json, computed by the same `fallback::next_target` the switch decision runs; ccsbar renders it (mirror = fallback for old daemons; ccsbar `e4f2d24`). Companion `set_last_resort` socket command (`2410a5b`) + ccsbar real-flag config UI replacing the threshold-100 convention (ccsbar `858001d`, 134 tests). Deployed live 2026-07-07: clauth 0.7.4 installed, daemon restarted, ccsbar repackaged+relaunched. 674 tests |
| **UP-4** — contribute-back round 2 | ✅ done 2026-07-07 | PR [#21](https://github.com/uwuclxdy/clauth/pull/21) + PR [#22](https://github.com/uwuclxdy/clauth/pull/22) **merged** (v0.8.0) with upstream follow-ups: `acdcf86` reap-on-stdin-failure, `089a696` confirm-before-reauth. Fork re-synced in `19c50f9`. AUTH-1 + daemon offers on [#1](https://github.com/uwuclxdy/clauth/issues/1) still unanswered |
| **UP-5** — rotation coherence (the #1 residual, fired live) | 🔶 in flight | 2026-07-07 incident: daemon rotation revoked CC's Keychain chain → running claude "Not logged in" while every clauth copy showed `ok` (and the reverse direction quarantined xfx/xfx-backup — see daemon.log). Fix: (a) `apply_rotated_tokens_locked` mirrors the ACTIVE profile's fresh pair into the Keychain (foreign-login gate: `live_login_is_foreign`), (b) proactive rotation `ACTIVE_ROTATE_LEAD_MS`=30 min ahead of expiry so the daemon always wins the single-use-chain race. 692 tests. Upstream PR [#24](https://github.com/uwuclxdy/clauth/pull/24) opened + on-device report on [#1](https://github.com/uwuclxdy/clauth/issues/1#issuecomment-4910017468). **v2 after review (2026-07-08)**: adopt-don't-race — `try_adopt_live_rotation` adopts CC's fresher pair from the live file mirror (identity-guarded via `/api/oauth/profile` uuid, anchor cached per profile), lead reframed to interval-derived (3 polls, 3-min floor); fork 710 tests + PR branch through `f34f0aa`. **Multipass review round (2026-07-08)**: 2 confirmed findings fixed — adopted pair now returned + synced into the TokenList as `rotated` (HIGH: stale entry would spend the revoked refresh and falsely quarantine), blank-uuid identity refused (LOW: Some("")==Some("") shape drift). Deployed live |
| **UP-6** — weekly-cap truth + contribute round 4 (2026-07-08) | 🔶 review | 7d=100 members were fallback targets AND kept "recovering" every 5h rollover (fork `dd5ccf9`, upstream PR [#26](https://github.com/uwuclxdy/clauth/pull/26)); the daemon-published forecast walked BLIND (`Profile.usage` is TUI-only — hydrated from disk caches, `044781f`); ccsbar legacy mirror got weekly parity. PR #25 review round done (comments→tests, `3e23619`); daemon/ccsbar appetite discussion opened as [#27](https://github.com/uwuclxdy/clauth/issues/27) |
| **AUTH-4** — a dead login is itself a switch trigger (the broken-active wedge) | ✅ done 2026-07-09 | Live incident: ax-main's refresh chain died mid-window (no identity anchor → adopt couldn't verify → quarantined); the daemon then sat on the corpse for hours while ax-backup idled at 0% — `scan_auto_switch` requires a `Fresh` active read (impossible for a dead login) and `next_auto_switch_target` requires exhaustion (a frozen-lapsed 5h window reads as headroom). Fix (three sites): broken-active bypasses the freshness gate (`scan_auto_switch`) + the exhaustion gate (`next_auto_switch_target`, `auto_switch_if_needed` TUI parity); **wrap-off still keys on REAL exhaustion only** — the flag alone never halts a possibly-healthy live session. Companion fixes: (B3) the reauth path `overwrite_captured_profile` now lifts the quarantine like `capture_into_profile` always did (the old AUTH-3 test covered the wrong path — reauth via menu bar left the flag + banner up after a successful login); (B5) identity anchor (`account_id.json`) backfills on the hourly `/profile` tier fetch, write-if-missing, zero extra HTTP — closes the "anchor-less profile wedges forever once its pair dies" hole that caused this incident. Review round (3-lens + adversarial verify, correctness lens clean): `mark_auth_broken` + the reauth clear now persist as **narrow `update_app_state` deltas** (blind whole-state saves could cross-process clobber, TECH-7 surface); forecast doc + README reworded — the published `forecast` is a PROJECTION of the walk, the live decision additionally gates on freshness/exhaustion/broken; anchor seed's non-atomic missing-check documented as accepted (fail-safe: wrong anchor only ever REFUSES adoption). Mutation-tested: gate reverts fail the new tests (`scan_auto_switch_walks_off…`, `auto_switch_if_needed_walks_off…`, `mark_auth_broken_merges…`); the two wrap-off tests are deliberate invariant guards (non-distinguishing pre-fix, they pin the `&& active_exhausted` Off key). Also hardened `cross_thread_with_state_lock_serializes` (unsandboxed → raced the global home override; now HomeSandbox-pinned). 719 tests ×4, clippy+fmt clean. Known accepted debt: `overwrite_captured_profile`'s tail is still a blind whole-state save for NON-auth_broken fields (pre-existing; TECH-7 parity is a separate follow-up). Deployed: fork `bd5c116` pushed, daemon restarted on it, stale flags hand-cleared from `profiles.toml` (`ax-main` + rename-ghost `xfx-cl`) BEFORE the AUTH-4 binary started (order matters — the new gate would have acted on the stale flag). Ported upstream: PR #25 `7ecdda8` (AUTH-4 gates; its branch already had the reauth clear — the FORK had drifted behind its own PR there, which is what made B3 fork-only) + `82a6354` (fail-alive test hardening cherry-picked from #24; the flake reproduced during port verification), PR #24 `48179cb` (anchor backfill), comments posted on both. Attribution note: the ax-main→ax-backup switch during the fix window was executed by the OLD binary (new daemon's `last_switch` is null); daemon.log lines carry no timestamps, which made reconstruction guesswork — fixed same-day as TECH-15 |
| **TECH-15** — timestamped daemon.log lines | ✅ done 2026-07-10 | AUTH-4's forensics had to guess hours of switch/quarantine ordering from undated lines. New `src/logline.rs`: `logline!` macro (drop-in for `eprintln!`) + process-sticky `enable_timestamps()` flipped first thing in `daemon::serve()` — daemon stderr gains an ISO-8601 UTC prefix (`2026-07-10T09:13:13+00:00 clauth daemon: …`), CLI/TUI stderr stays bare (interactive noise). All 24 daemon-reachable sites converted (daemon/{mod,socket,tick}.rs, oauth.rs transitions/adopt, profile.rs prune warning); `clauth start` session-wrapper stderr (runtime.rs/start.rs) deliberately left alone — different surface, flag never set there. Format pinned by `render()` unit tests. 721 tests, clippy/fmt clean; deployed + verified live (standby's waiting line stamps too, since enable precedes the lock wait). **Upstream: HELD — verified 2026-07-10 that `upstream/mommy` has NO daemon module at all** (no `src/daemon/`, no `daemon` subcommand; the entire daemon/socket/status.json surface is fork-only, which is exactly what issue [#27](https://github.com/uwuclxdy/clauth/issues/27) is negotiating). TECH-15 upstream is inert until the daemon itself lands there. **#27 ANSWERED YES 2026-07-11** (minimal scope: usage-refresh + auto-switch + logging) — the daemon-module PR (with TECH-15 aboard) is actionable once #24/#25 land |
| **CBAR-5** — in-app "Add account…" (new-profile browser sign-in) | ✅ done 2026-07-08 | ccsbar `5bbf8d6` (feature: ⊕ row + inline banner + AddAccountValidation mirroring clauth's rules + injected-run tests, 149 green) + `9546851` (review round: all 4 verified findings fixed). clauth side: `login --new` flag (`7d0a894` — race-proof create; refuses reauth of an existing name against freshly-loaded config; 695 tests) because a UI-side collision pre-block is a TOCTOU and non-TTY spawns skip the reauth confirm. Deployed: app repackaged + relaunched. Follow-up ccsbar `4ca23cd`: SwitchMachine pending deadline now EXTENDS while status.json `pending_switch` still holds the target (2s re-checks, 30s ceiling) — first switch to a fresh account was false-failing at the blind 6s timeout while the daemon legitimately deferred its mid-fetch target |
| **UP-2** — `security -i` stdin keychain write (answers upstream's PR #18 EDR note) | ✅ done | `write_at` feeds `add-generic-password` to `security -i` over stdin — token no longer in argv (out of `es_event_exec_t` EDR logs). Tokenizer rules pinned empirically: quoted `\`/`"` escapes round-trip byte-identical; unquoted whitespace splits; inner exit code propagates (0/44/2); newline in value = loud refusal. KC-1 `--ignored` round-trip re-run vs real Keychain (throwaway service) incl. hostile-content token — passes |

### CBAR-2 — rich menu bar + fallback configuration
Added a second layer to the menu bar (the operator asked for weekly + fable usage,
visible fallback chain/status, a clearer active-account indicator, more dropdown
info, and *editing* the chain from the bar):
- **Rust:** `src/fallback_config.rs` — one home for chain edits (add/remove/move/
  threshold/wrap-off) + persistence (`save_app_state`/`save_profile`). The daemon
  exposes them over `clauthd.sock` as five new commands — `fallback_add`,
  `fallback_remove`, `fallback_move` (`dir`), `set_threshold` (`value` 0..=100),
  `set_wrap_off` (`value` bool) — which enqueue a `ConfigOp` (rank
  `PendingConfigOps`=1600) that the main loop drains + applies + persists (same
  leaf-drain-then-`config`-lock discipline as `drain_pending_switch`). `status.json`
  gained a top-level `fallback_chain` (ordered names). The TUI's own fallback editor
  still has parallel inline logic — migrating it onto `fallback_config` is a noted
  follow-up (see the module doc), left out to keep this change socket-scoped.
- **Swift (ccsbar):** account rows now show 5h/7d/fable bars + reset hints + the
  fallback line; a `Fallback chain` summary row; a `Configure ▸` submenu (per-account
  threshold picker / move up-down / add-remove + a wrap-off toggle) driving the new
  socket commands; the menu-bar title shows the active account **name** + 5h%.
- **Verified live:** all five config commands round-tripped over the socket against
  real config (add/move/remove chain, threshold 95→80→95, wrap-off on/off), every
  error case returns `ok:false`, config restored to baseline. `cargo test` passed,
  clippy clean; `swift build` clean; new daemon + ccsbar relaunched.
- **Multipass review (3-lens adversarial):** 7 findings, 6 fixed —
  (1) glyph showed green "0%" for a never-fetched active account → now "—";
  (2) fable window matched an exact server-derived label → lenient `"7d …fable…"`;
  (3) `drain_config_ops` bumped `last_state_mtime` without a real `profiles.toml`
  write → primitives now return `Ok(true/false)` (wrote-state), bump gated on it;
  (4) `add()` two-file write non-atomic → all primitives roll back the in-memory
  mutation on save failure (memory never diverges from disk);
  (7) third-party rows showed three empty bars → now render an availability dot.
  (5, low) account-row custom colors didn't invert under the NSMenu hover
  highlight — an `attributedTitle` limitation → **resolved by CBAR-3**: the
  SwiftUI `MenuBarExtra(.window)` panel draws its own tiles/controls, so there is
  no NSMenu highlight to fight.

### CBAR-3 — CodexBar-aesthetic SwiftUI redesign (ccsbar `745dae3`)
The operator asked to "make it prettier, matching CodexBar." Rebuilt the menu bar
from `NSMenu` + block-character (█░) bars to a SwiftUI `MenuBarExtra(.window)`
translucent panel — the model **current CodexBar actually uses** (superseding the
DESIGN §2 `NSMenu`-hosting recommendation; DESIGN.md updated to match).
- **Structure:** account-switcher tiles (active filled in the terracotta accent) →
  the active account's Session/Weekly/Fable meters (thin rounded `UsageBar`s, "%
  used" + "resets in …", days for long windows) → an armed-glow fallback-chain
  strip → an inline `Configure` disclosure → Refresh/Quit. Third-party api-key
  accounts render an availability dot. Every control is custom `.plain`-styled to
  match the panel's drawn capsules (no `Menu`/`Toggle` system chrome mismatch).
- **Files:** `Theme` (SwiftUI tokens + `UsageBar` + `resetHint`), `StatusModel`
  (`@MainActor ObservableObject` poll + daemon commands), `PanelView`, `ConfigView`,
  `AppMain` (`MenuBarExtra(.window)` + `--snapshot`), `Snapshot` (headless
  `ImageRenderer` panel→PNG design-review harness). `StatusItemController` deleted.
- **Verified:** `swift build`/release clean (Swift 6 strict concurrency); the
  `--snapshot` render confirmed the layout + caught a reset-time bug ("136h" → "5d
  16h"); packaged `.app` relaunched against the live daemon. No Rust changes.

### R3 deferral (documented, not forgotten)
Daemon-side single-instance guard is done (advisory flock on `~/.clauth/clauthd.lock`).
The remaining half — TUI detects a live daemon and skips its own `spawn_refresher`,
following the daemon's on-disk caches — is deferred: it needs a "follow daemon"
display mode + routing manual refresh (`r`) to the socket. When both run
concurrently, the cross-process state flock prevents corruption; the cost is a doubled request rate /
auto-start kicks. Marker comment at `src/tui/app.rs::start_scheduler`.

## Ground truth (macOS, CC v2.1.199) — do not re-derive

- CC reads its live login from the **Keychain** (`service="Claude Code-credentials",
  account=$USER`), and *mirrors* it into `~/.claude/.credentials.json` (a 0600 plain
  file) every run. Editing the file alone does NOT switch a running `claude`;
  rewriting the Keychain does.
- A **fresh** `/login` under a custom `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` writes **only** a per-config-
  dir hashed Keychain item (`Claude Code-credentials-<hash>`), never that dir's
  `.credentials.json`. → upstream's `clauth login` reports "no login detected" on
  macOS. This is why the fork uses its own browser-PKCE login (writes the file
  directly). Corrected upstream: uwuclxdy/clauth#1 (comment).
- Always-Allow ACL binds to the **calling binary's code signature**. Route Keychain
  writes through Apple's stable `/usr/bin/security` so the grant persists across
  ad-hoc-signed rebuilds (`dist/macos/signed-install.sh` pins a stable identity).
- The scheduler (`usage::scheduler::spawn_refresher`) already persists
  `usage_cache.json` inside `apply_outcome`, so the daemon and TUI share one cache.
- Lock ranks: `CONFIG` (400) outranks `USAGE_STATUS` (350); snapshot the live stores
  before taking `config` (the daemon's `write_status` does this).

## Real-usage acceptance (run 2026-07-03 with the operator's explicit authorization)

Ran against the live config/accounts (xfx↔cl-ax), all reversible; verified each
switch by hashing the `Claude Code-credentials` Keychain item (no secret printed)
and confirmed state fully restored to xfx afterward.

1. **Manual switch** ✅ — `clauth cl-ax` rewrote the Keychain (fp `6961c0be…`→
   `0462b617…`); `clauth xfx` restored it. A switch really rewrites the Keychain.
2. **Daemon auto-switch (the core requirement)** ✅ — lowered xfx's
   `fallback_threshold` to 1 (< its 2% 5h), ran `clauth daemon` headless (no TUI);
   it auto-switched xfx→cl-ax in **~3 s** (Keychain rewritten; `daemon.log`:
   `auto-switched to 'cl-ax'`). Restored threshold + active. Unattended switch works.
3. **ccsbar socket IPC** ✅ — drove `clauthd.sock` with the exact newline-JSON
   ccsbar sends (`{"cmd":"snapshot"}`, `{"cmd":"switch","profile":…}`); daemon
   replied `{"ok":true}` and executed the switch (Keychain verified). Rust↔Swift
   `status.json` contract matches field-for-field (incl. window shape).

Still operator-only (can't be automated): **browser OAuth `clauth login`** (needs a
human to approve in the browser) and the **menu-bar visual/aesthetic** (their call).

## Verification (this branch)
- `cargo test` → 484 passed, 0 failed. `cargo clippy --all-targets` clean; `cargo fmt --all -- --check` clean.
- `clauth status --json` against real caches: schema 1, correct active/fallback/
  windows; never-fetched profile nulls out.
- `clauth daemon`: boots, writes `status.json` (0600), ticks (generated_at advances),
  single-instance guard rejects a second instance; `clauthd.sock` (0600) answers
  snapshot/switch/refresh. Auto-switch + socket switch verified live (see above).
- Note: `status.json` is only rewritten while a daemon runs; a manual `clauth <name>`
  with no daemon leaves the file stale (by design — ccsbar shows a staleness cue).

## CBAR-4 track progress (from `docs/ccsbar/CBAR-4-PLAN.md`)

| Milestone | State | Commit | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| **AUTH-1** — pre-install auth gate (Incident C): never install a stale/dead token | ✅ done | `f9701fb` | `oauth::ensure_installable` gates every install choke point (CLI `switch_profile_cli`; socket + daemon auto-switch via `drain_pending_switch`): third-party bypass, refresh an expiring token before install, quarantine a revoked one (`AppState.auth_broken`, persisted) + refuse loudly. Permanent (4xx→quarantine) vs transient (network/5xx→retry, no quarantine) split; refresh runs under RotationGuard with no config lock held; injected refresher = offline-testable. Chain walk (`next_target` / `next_auto_switch_target` via `ChainSnapshot.broken` / `scan_recovery`) skips broken in headroom AND sink pass; broken-sink+wrap-off → OFF. 10 new tests. `cargo test` 494, clippy/fmt clean |
| **AUTH-2** — surface auth + switch truth in the contracts | ✅ done | `d4c0f41` | status.json per-profile `auth_status` (ok/expiring/broken, broken outranks expiring, absent=ok) + top-level `pending_switch` (via `LiveSignals`); socket `ok:false` gains stable `error_code` (unknown_profile/busy/auth_broken/invalid_value) + synchronous `switch`→auth_broken refusal with login hint; DESIGN.md §3 synced. 4 new tests. `cargo test` 498, clippy/fmt clean. Verified live: `clauth status --json` shows `auth_status` on every profile + top-level `pending_switch` |
| **CBAR4-1** — foundation: color roles + type floor + threshold tick | ✅ done | ccsbar `9f1d3c8` | Implements CBAR-4-DESIGN §4 (type scale) + §5 (color semantics) foundation. **Color — four roles, one meaning per hue** (dissolves the five-meanings-of-terracotta overload): `accent` #D97757 terracotta = ACTIVE only (no longer the healthy-bar fill); NEW `actVerb` #B85C33 = the ACT-verb button fill (≥4.5:1 AA under white); `sapphire` #43ABE5 = ARMED/WATCHING (sole armed hue); `success`/`warning`/`danger` now **light/dark DYNAMIC pairs** via `NSColor(name:dynamicProvider:)` (Catppuccin Latte in light, Mocha in dark) — fixes the flat-Mocha 1.3–2.3:1 light-mode contrast failures; `usageColor` healthy band → GREEN headroom keyed to each account's own threshold (terracotta never on a bar). **Type floor (§4):** AccountTile names → `.body` (13pt) + lineLimit(1) + tail truncation + `.help`; **`minimumScaleFactor` removed everywhere** (overflow truncates, never shrinks). **UsageBar:** optional in-track threshold tick (§8 Roster graft) — a hairline at the account's own auto-switch threshold so distance-to-rotation is pre-attentive; suppressed at 100 (sink/no-threshold); wired into row + Session 5h bars. **DaemonClient `Result` refactor: already satisfied by TECH-11's `CommandOutcome`** (.ok/.daemonError(code,message)/.unreachable + off-`@MainActor` `Task.detached` socket I/O + immediate error surfacing, 6s reserved for accepted-then-dropped) — functionally equivalent to the plan's `Result<Void, DaemonError>`; not re-churned. Acceptance: `swift build` clean, `swift test` **40/40** (usageColor bands re-pinned green-healthy + a roles-distinct test), `rg minimumScaleFactor Sources` → none, socket off-main, `--snapshot=healthy` renders. |
| **CBAR4-2** — forecast engine + liveness ladder (truthfulness core) | ✅ done | ccsbar `f24869e` | Two PURE test-first engines. **`ForecastEngine.nextTarget(_:now:)`** — a CONTRACTUAL mirror of clauth `fallback.rs::next_target` (line-pinned: walk_chain :127, next_target :154, is_exhausted :33, threshold_for :24 DEFAULT 95); predicts the daemon's next auto-switch target for every "would switch to X" string (naive position+1 banned, risk #2). Pass order headroom → 100%-sink → wrap-off→OFF; skip set = active / unresolvable / auth-broken (AUTH-1); `five_hour_live` = resets_at in the future (lapsed window = headroom); `now` injected. **`LivenessLadder.freshness`** — graded live <5s / syncing 5–15s / dead ≥15s on the 1s write cadence (§8 Roster graft, supersedes the binary 10s cliff) + statusMtime cross-check (younger age wins). **Keyed to the FIXED 1s cadence, NOT `refresh_interval_ms`** — `StatusModel.staleness` now uses it, **fixing TECH-4's refresh-interval-keyed threshold** that let a dead daemon read fresh for minutes (same cadence-vs-refetch trap TECH-12's doctor fixed on the Rust side). `DaemonStatus` gains additive per-profile `auth_status` + `authBroken` (AUTH-2 field the Swift model wasn't decoding). Tests: **16 new** (forecast all five scenarios + wrap-around-past-end + unresolvable + sink-pass-auth-broken + lapsed + degenerate; liveness band + cross-check boundaries via injected ages). Acceptance: `swift build` clean, `swift test` **54/54**. Reviewed (code-reviewer, opus): **mirror confirmed FAITHFUL across all 8 decision points + both cross-boundary contracts** (auth_status/is_auth_broken, threshold/threshold_for) verified against `status_json.rs`; 3 test-coverage-gap findings (wrap-around untested — risk #2's whole point — + unresolvable + sink-pass-auth-broken unpinned) all fixed with new fixtures. |
| **CBAR4-3** — switch state machine (arm/pending/confirm/fail) | ✅ done | ccsbar `ab822c3` | A PURE `SwitchMachine` reducer + its StatusModel effect wiring (design §2 STATE 3). **Machine (unit-tested):** Phase {idle, arming(target), pending(target), confirmed(target,viaCLI), failed(reason)} driven by events (requestSwitch w/ live-session flag, confirmArm, cancel, dispatched, observedActive, arm/pending timeouts, dismiss); instant failure on refused/unreachable, 6s timeout reserved for accepted-then-silently-dropped, double-tap mid-switch ignored. **`DaemonClient.switchTo` → `SwitchDispatch` {accepted, confirmedByCLI, refused(code,message), unreachable}** — the accepted-vs-confirmedByCLI split is load-bearing: a socket switch confirms by OBSERVING status.json, a CLI switch (daemon dead) confirms by EXIT CODE because a dead daemon never rewrites status.json (design §8 CLI-fallback honesty fix); no-fallback-on-rejection invariant preserved via a testable send/cli seam. **StatusModel** drives it: enter() runs per-phase effects (arm 5s / pending 6s timers, off-main dispatch, a status.json observation ladder feeding .observedActive); `switchInFlight` now derived from the phase; **rotation heartbeat** flashes "rotated to X" (8s) on an unattended auto-switch, guarded so a local switch's landing never false-flashes. Tests: **19 new** (SwitchMachine all paths + CommandOutcome dispatch paths incl. CLI confirm/refuse/unreachable), 73 total green. Reviewed (code-reviewer, opus): **wiring SOUND, no CRITICAL/HIGH** (actor isolation, timer cancellation, dispatch re-entrancy, no-fallback, double-confirm, rotation-flash ordering all verified); **3 findings fixed** — [MED] observe ladder's per-iteration sleeps summed PAST the 6s timeout (only 3 reads fit) so a switch landing in (4.2s,6s) false-failed → tightened cadence to land all reads <6s + added a final confirm-check at the deadline before declaring failure; [LOW×2] per-iteration-vs-cumulative ladder comments + dismiss-timer safety note. Acceptance: `swift build` clean, `swift test` **73/73**, four snapshot states render. **arm-confirm UI + the "Switch to X" verb land in CBAR4-4** (machine drives straight to pending until the confirm button exists). |
| **CBAR4-6** — menu-bar label state ladder | ✅ done (out of order — pure, before the CBAR4-4 visual rebuild) | ccsbar `48e3e95` | A PURE `MenuBarLabelLadder.spec(status, switchInFlight, rotationFlash, now) → LabelSpec` (design §6) — ALL state encoded in SF Symbol SHAPE, never color (the menu bar template-renders + flattens custom hues); the `%` always means the ACTIVE account's 5h window. Priority ladder (highest wins): (1) daemon DEAD (generated_at age >15s) → warning triangle + frozen age, **% WITHHELD**; (2) switch in flight → trailing ellipsis; (3) rotation flash → ⇄ name; (4) wrap-off all-off → power glyph + "off"; (5) no status.json → bare gauge; (6) 5h ≥ threshold → high-gauge; (7) ≥ 0.8×threshold → gauge + near-threshold dot; (9) normal; with (8) DISARMED (empty chain or zero armed) appending bolt.slash. Third-party active → availability dot, never %. Name tail-truncated to 12 chars. `MenuBarLabel` view rewired to render the spec (the old ad-hoc gauge+dim is gone). Tests: **16 new** — one per rung + collision precedence (dead>in-flight>rotation>wrap-off; over-threshold+disarmed co-occur) + truncation + third-party. **89 total green.** Done before CBAR4-4 because it's pure+independent (drives the separate menu-bar view) — same "land the tested truthfulness engine first" rationale the plan uses for forecast/liveness. SF Symbol NAME choices are the operator's visual call (CBAR4-7); the rung LOGIC is fully pinned by tests. |
| **CBAR4-4** — the inspect-first Preflight panel rebuild | ✅ done | ccsbar `e7b5e1a` | The visible redesign (design §2 wireframes / §3 interaction map): **status strip → account LIST → detail card → chain rail → actions**. Browse freely (single click inspects, **zero daemon traffic**), switch deliberately (**one** verb in the detail card). Consumes every CBAR4-1/2/3/6 engine. **New components:** `StatusStrip` — the SINGLE exception surface, priority-ordered §3.10 (dead-daemon banner w/ [Start daemon] spawn + [Copy] > switch lifecycle arm/pending/confirmed/failed incl. "via CLI · auto-switch inactive" > wrap-off resume-ETA card > zero-armed warning > forecast sentence + liveness stamp). `AccountRow` — **file-order rows that NEVER reorder** (§2 — only the ✓ badge + inspection ring move); badge cluster (armed bolt / sink flag / in-use / auth-broken / fetch), full-width 5h bar + threshold tick + 13pt %, half-width 7d/Fable bars, third-party availability line (never %-bars), 60% dim + greyscale + "as of Xm ago" when dead. `DetailCard` — inspected windows, forecast-driven chain-membership line, and THE one switch surface: static "Active account" / disabled "login expired" (→ upgraded to a one-click reauth verb in **AUTH-3**) / a **unified** Switch verb sharing the arm-confirm→pending cycle in BOTH the live and offline (Switch via CLI) paths. **StatusModel:** inspection state (inspect/reset/isInspected, **chain-head fallback when active is null** §3.1), forecast/forecastSentence/chainLine (ordinal-aware), autoSwitchIdle, wrapOffResumeETA, freshness/frozen-age helpers, startDaemon; `listProfiles` is now file-order; `isPreview` gates the open-reset so snapshot states survive rendering. `PanelView` orchestrates strip+accounts+detail+chain+actions with state routing (.outOfDate/.down/.ok/.stalled) + keyboard floor (⌘↩ switch, R refresh, ⌘Q quit, ↑/↓ inspect). Snapshot extended to the FOUR canonical states (default / inspecting / mid-switch / daemon-dead), all rendered + visually verified against the wireframes. Tests: **PanelLogicTests** (ordinal 11/12/13/111 edges, forecast sentence, chain line sink-vs-armed, autoSwitchIdle, wrap-off ETA, chain-head inspection fallback) + rewritten StatusModel inspection tests. **94 total green.** Reviewed (code-reviewer, opus): rebuild logically SOUND, no CRITICAL/HIGH; ALL findings fixed — [MED] dead/offline switch button could arm with no confirm affordance (unified the two buttons so the arm-confirm cycle works offline too); [MED] inspection fallback used first profile not first CHAIN member on active-null; [LOW] detail stamp shows age "Fresh · 3s" not the self-contradictory "· frozen"; [LOW] honest startDaemon comment + surface missing-binary. Live-app hover/keyboard/aesthetic sign-off is the operator's (CBAR4-7). Acceptance: `swift build` clean, `swift test` **94/94**, four `--snapshot` states render. |
| **CBAR4-5** — config surfaces: context menu + upgraded disclosure | ✅ done | ccsbar `d9b64e0` | The two §7 config surfaces (no Settings window), sharing **one** vocabulary. **FAST PATH** `AccountContextMenu` — a native right-click menu on every row at free NSMenu metrics: Switch / Refresh `<name>` / Add–Remove / Move up–down / "Leave chain at ▸" preset submenu (50/80/90/95/**Last resort 100%**) / Copy name. Switch **inspects-then-fires** so a live-session arm surfaces its Confirm in the detail card (not stranded) and relabels to "via CLI (daemon offline)" when the daemon's down. **CANONICAL EDITOR** — the inline Configure disclosure rebuilt to the **28pt hit-target standard** (13pt labels, 22×22pt glyphs in 28pt targets, threshold legend, wrap-off as an **outcome-language radio** "Stay on last account" / "Switch everything off — credentials cleared; resumes when a window resets"); the **"wrap-off" jargon is retired from ALL user-facing copy** (test-enforced sweep). **`ChainEdit`** — the single source of truth both surfaces + the chain rail read (presets, labels, legends, wrap-off copy, `currentThresholdLabel`, `whenSpentSummary`, and the pure `removalConsequence` armed-member gate). **Armed-member removal confirm** — removing an ARMED member routes through `requestRemove` → `pendingRemoval` (**no socket fired**) and surfaces a **PANEL-LEVEL** confirm banner (visible from BOTH the context menu and the disclosure, disclosure collapsed by default); copy is truthful about whether auto-switch actually stops (`disablesAutoSwitch` vs `armedMember`). **Lifecycle** — honest `configInFlight`/`configBusy` "Applying…" shimmer on real edits (refreshes suppress it); revert-with-reason + red banner via the TECH-11 `run()` path. Snapshot gains `config` + `remove-confirm` variants (both rendered + verified vs §7). Tests: **ConfigSurfaceTests** (preset list + sink label, no-jargon sweep, `removalConsequence` all four branches with truthful prompts, `requestRemove` arms without dispatching a socket) — **8 new, 102 total green**; tests never touch the real `~/.clauth` socket (operator constraint) — only pure decisions + the armed path that returns before any command. Reviewed (code-reviewer, opus): **ALL findings fixed** — [HIGH] context-menu armed removal was a silent no-op with the disclosure collapsed (lifted the confirm to a panel-level banner); [MED] chain-rail wrap-off copy hand-rolled a third surface (routed through `ChainEdit`); [LOW×4] current-threshold label divergence + 0-based test fixture position + offline-switch label + refresh shimmer; [NIT] `armedMember` prompt assertion. Concurrency (`configInFlight` main-actor 1:1, no leak/negative) + socket safety verified clean. Live-daemon config-lifecycle on a scratch chain is operator acceptance (CBAR4-7). Acceptance: `swift build` clean, `swift test` **102/102**, `--snapshot=config`+`=remove-confirm` render + match §7. |
| **CBAR4-7** — sync + acceptance (docs, packaging; live tests operator-only) | ✅ done (agent scope); ⏳ operator acceptance pending | ccsbar `c3fed2b` (README), clauth `<this>` (DESIGN §4 + ledger) | **Docs synced to the Preflight model:** ccsbar `README.md` rewritten off the pre-CBAR-4 tap-to-switch tiles → click=inspect / switch-is-a-verb, the status-strip→list→detail→chain→actions layout, the truthfulness engines, two config surfaces, the SF-Symbol label ladder, six `--snapshot` variants, and a full Architecture table (points at `CBAR-4-DESIGN.md` as binding). clauth `docs/ccsbar/DESIGN.md` §4 gains a **superseded banner** → CBAR-4-DESIGN.md (color/liveness semantics still feed it; the tile *layout* is historical); "Shipped divergence" + §6 sequencing marked pre-CBAR-4 with the CBAR-4 rebuild appended. **neat-freak reconciliation run** — enumerated both repos' docs + memory; only the two files above drifted (memory dir empty → in-repo ledger is source of truth; clauth README's daemon/socket contract unchanged + accurate); self-check clean (no relative-time, no stray present-tense tile refs, all doc links resolve). **Packaging:** `Scripts/package_app.sh` builds `build/ccsbar.app` (release, LSUIElement, ad-hoc signed) — **release build clean**. **Operator-only acceptance (NOT run — per constraints):** (a) `open build/ccsbar.app` + the four-state walkthrough (default/inspecting/mid-switch/daemon-dead) — the aesthetic sign-off is the operator's; (b) a **real two-account switch** (logs out every running Claude Code process → operator's call when). Hand-off commands below. |
| — **CBAR-4 track COMPLETE** (agent scope) | ✅ all 9 milestones done | AUTH-1 `f9701fb` · AUTH-2 `d4c0f41` · CBAR4-1 `9f1d3c8` · CBAR4-2 `f24869e` · CBAR4-3 `ab822c3` · CBAR4-6 `48e3e95` · CBAR4-4 `e7b5e1a` · CBAR4-5 `d9b64e0` · CBAR4-7 `c3fed2b` | Rust: `cargo test` 498 + clippy/fmt clean (AUTH gates). Swift: `swift build`/release clean, `swift test` **102/102**, six `--snapshot` states render + verified vs §2/§7 wireframes. All commits LOCAL (no push — operator constraint). **Remaining = operator acceptance only:** launch the packaged app, walk the four states, run one real switch. |
| **AUTH-3** — proactive dropped-login detection + one-click browser reauth (operator ask: "有时候 oauth 会掉") | ✅ done (post-track follow-on) | daemon `53e933a` · ccsbar `d109c95` | **Root cause:** AUTH-1 flags `auth_broken` only on the *switch/install* path; the daemon's usage-refresh poll (`usage::scheduler::fetch_with_rotation`) called `oauth::refresh` (flattens `RefreshError`→anyhow) and on ANY failure silently fell back to cache — so a dead refresh token dropped a login with **no signal** until the next switch attempt. **Daemon fix:** poll now calls `oauth::refresh_result` (preserves `RefreshError::Invalid`/`Transient`); a pure `refresh_failure_is_terminal` helper (Invalid→true, Transient→false) gates `oauth::mark_auth_broken(config,name,true)` on a terminal failure and `…,false)` (clears) after a successful rotation — so a dead login surfaces in `status.json` the moment the poll sees it, and a transient network blip never false-flags. `mark_auth_broken` → `pub(crate)`. 2 new inline tests (`dead_refresh_token_is_terminal`, `transient_refresh_failure_is_not_terminal`) wired into feature_coverage's "Automatic token refresh" map. **ccsbar fix (d109c95):** the `auth_broken` detail-card state (was a *disabled* "login expired" hint in CBAR4-4) becomes a **`reauthSurface`** — danger shield + terracotta **"Log in again"** verb that spawns `clauth login <name>` (self-contained browser OAuth, works daemon-up or -down; capture clears the flag). `StatusModel.reauth` — single in-flight guard, flag set synchronously, spawn awaited off-`@MainActor` via `withCheckedContinuation`, socket refresh nudged **only** when the daemon is reachable (a daemon-down `.ok` must not surface a spurious refresh error); `reauthFailureMessage` maps the outcome to a loud message with the exact terminal fallback command. `AccountContextMenu` gains an anthropic-only "Log in again / Re-authenticate (browser)" item; `PanelView` shows a **global** in-flight banner (a proactive reauth of a healthy account still gets feedback); `Snapshot` gains a `reauth` variant. Reviewed (code-reviewer, opus): all findings fixed — [MED-HIGH] daemon-down spurious refresh error (gated on `daemonReachable`), [MED] parked-thread → async continuation, [MED] context-menu no-feedback → global banner, [LOW-MED] untested async lifecycle → 2 async tests, [LOW×2] fixture anthropic filter + reauthSurface provider guard, [NIT×2] stale CLI hint + timeout-contract doc. Acceptance: `cargo test` **539** (2 new), clippy/fmt clean; `swift build`/release clean, `swift test` **119/119**, `--snapshot=reauth` renders the shield + "Log in again" verb (visually verified). |
| **AUTH-3 hardening** — three bugs found during operator acceptance, all fixed + verified live | ✅ done | daemon `e599b7c` `5b06ade` · ccsbar `e003960` | Operator ran the real "Log in again" flow and hit three defects the initial AUTH-3 missed. **(1) Reauth was a no-op** (`e599b7c`): `clauth login <name>` bailed "already exists" for any existing profile (`validate_profile_name` `exclude=None`) — so the button spawned a command that failed before the browser opened. `cmd_login` is now idempotent (new name creates, existing RE-AUTHENTICATES); `config.add` upserts so the capture replaces rather than duplicates. **(2) A dead token behind a 429 was masked** (`e599b7c`): `fetch_with_rotation` bailed on ANY 429 without attempting a refresh, so a dropped login whose usage endpoint 429s showed "RateLimited" forever instead of `auth_broken`. Now a 429 on a **clock-expired** token falls through to the refresh (mirrors `auto_start_kick`'s 429 gate via pure `token_clock_expired`), surfacing the dead token; a 429 on a valid token still bails (a refresh can't fix an endpoint limit + would re-spend the single-use token). **(3) Reauth of the ACTIVE account never rewrote the Keychain** (`5b06ade`) — THE "Not logged in · run /login" bug: `capture_into_profile` re-linked the live credential only when it ADOPTED active (disk had no active); re-authing the already-active account left the Keychain on the dead token, so a running `claude` (which reads the Keychain, not the file) kept failing. Now when the captured profile IS the on-disk active one, **force-relink** (rewrites the Keychain with fresh tokens; the divergence guard is bypassed correctly since we replace this profile's OWN stale login). **(4) ccsbar** (`e003960`): `DetailCard.switchSurface` checked `p.active` before `p.authBroken`, hiding the reauth verb on an active broken account (the most urgent case) behind "Active account" — reordered so a broken login outranks the active readout; `reauth-active` snapshot variant regression-covers it. Tests: `token_clock_expired` ×3, `reauth_capture_upserts…`, `reauth_of_the_active_account_force_relinks_the_stale_mirror`; **550** daemon + **127** ccsbar green, clippy/fmt clean. **Operator acceptance PASSED live** — "login again 可以了 修好了" (the live `claude` session recovered immediately after the Keychain rewrite). |
| **RENAME-1** — rename a profile from ccsbar | ✅ done | daemon `4d114c4` · ccsbar `89d1a6d` | New `rename` control-socket command so the menu-bar app can rename a profile. **Daemon:** `fallback_config::rename(old,new)` — validates the new name (charset + collision, self-rename allowed), renames the profile dir, updates every reference (name list / chain / active marker / auth_broken) via the TECH-7 RMW delta (no clobber of a concurrent switch's `active_profile`), and force-relinks the credential mirror when the renamed profile is active (rewrites the Keychain → a live session follows the rename; same tokens, so no logout). Rolls back dir+state on a persist failure. `ConfigOp::Rename` drained under the config lock; socket `rename` validates synchronously (immediate `ok:false` on a taken/invalid name) with a new `new_name` field. **ccsbar:** context-menu "Rename…" (any provider) opens an inline `RenameBanner` at the panel top (TextField + live client-side validation mirroring the daemon rule + Rename/Cancel/⏎); an invalid name surfaces a loud error and never fires the socket; a valid one runs the settle ladder (waits for the renamed profile in status.json). Tests: 6 daemon (3 primitive + 3 socket) + 8 ccsbar (`RenameTests`); DESIGN.md §3 IPC contract + both READMEs synced. `--snapshot=rename` renders the banner. |

## TECH backlog progress (from `.agent/TECH-PLAN.md`)

| Milestone | State | Commits | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| **TECH-1** — branch backup, ledger truth & CI activation | ✅ done | `630afa7` (fmt), `178db03` (ledger+CI) | `feat/macos-keychain` pushed to origin (`178db03c…`, backup of the SPOF fork); `feat/macos-keychain-oauth` deleted → archived at tag `archive/feat-macos-keychain-oauth` (5531b9b); ci.yml push-trigger added → CI **run 28703818109 green** (check[fmt+clippy+test]/audit/deny all pass on ubuntu); ledger test count 465→484 = `cargo test` total; no PR opened (push-trigger path, per operator constraint) |
| **TECH-2** — fork install/update retargeting + Windows build gate | ✅ done | `bb7fe39` | `update.rs` `FORK_BUILD` disables the self-updater (`spawn`→None, `should_self_replace`→false; API_URL not retargeted); `install.sh` rewritten as source-build (no releases path / no crates.io); README + plugin-marketplace retargeted, **no `uwuclxdy`** in install.sh/README.md; `daemon-install.sh` capability check refuses a non-fork binary (**exit 1** verified); unix socket `#[cfg(unix)]`-gated + no-op stub → **`cargo check --target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu` exits 0** (was E0433; mingw local); ci.yml `windows-check` job added. Native: 500 tests, clippy -D/fmt clean. CI-green-on-push pending operator OK to push |
| **TECH-3** — daemon anti-wedge watchdog + standby supervision + keychain timeout | ✅ done | `26d3304` | tick heartbeat (AtomicU64) + watchdog thread `abort()`s on a >60s stall (pure `watchdog_check` unit-tested via injected flag — `cargo test daemon::watchdog` 4 pass); single-instance guard now BLOCKS as standby so launchd takes over when a manual daemon exits (#35); `run_with_deadline` gives every `security` call a 20s kill-on-expiry deadline so a stuck keychain can't pin the flock (`cargo test keychain_timeout` 2 pass, via `sleep`/`true` — no real Keychain). No unsafe. 506 tests, clippy -D/fmt clean, windows still compiles. Standby live kickstart test = operator-manual (real daemon relinks → touches real Keychain) |
| **TECH-5** — Daemon::tick extraction + inline test harness | ✅ done | `e53cea1` | Loop body (reload_if_changed / drain_pending_switch / drain_pending_switch_off / drain_config_ops + rebuild_tokens) extracted to new `src/daemon/tick.rs` behind `Daemon::tick()`; **pure refactor, no runtime behavior change** (tick() preserves exact call order; run() calls self.tick() then stamps heartbeat). mod.rs **632→421 LOC** (under the 500 gate); tick.rs 244. New `tests/inline/daemon_mod.rs` (mirrors socket.rs:211 `mod tests`) pins CURRENT behavior on 5 tests — `cargo test daemon::tests` **5 pass, deterministic 5/5 runs**: tick empty-queue no-op writes status; drain_pending_switch executes idle+clean target; **skips on active_diverged_unsaved** (CC re-login); drain_config_ops threshold(Ok(false)) does **not** suppress a same-tick external reload (the ledger's eyeballed mtime regression, now pinned); reload_if_changed fires on external mtime. All via `testutil::HomeSandbox` + keychain-disabled — **no real ~/.clauth / ~/.claude / Keychain touched**. feature_coverage 'Headless daemon' row now names the tick tests (`cargo test features_have_test_coverage` pass). Total 506→511, clippy -D/fmt clean. Unblocks TECH-6/7 (TDD-able). **Carry-forward debt (→ TECH-14 hygiene):** `runtime::tests::has_live_session_*` / `live_session_count_*` are a *pre-existing* flock-release/HOME-isolation flake (~1/3–1/5 full-suite runs on the **clean tree too**, correlated cluster, different subsystem, outside this diff) — NOT introduced or causally worsened by TECH-5 (daemon_mod is 100% green every run). |
| **TECH-13** — ccsbar test target + status.json fixture contract | ✅ done | ccsbar `f2ce638` | The executable had ZERO tests (SwiftPM can't test an executable's internals). **Library split:** `CCSBarKit` library (all logic, everything `internal`) + thin `ccsbar` executable (`Entry.swift`: `@main`→`runCCSBar()`, the one `public` symbol) + `CCSBarKitTests` via `@testable import`. `@main` stays in the executable; `CCSBarApp.main()` called explicitly as before — **no behavior change** (reviewed). **Single source of truth:** inline `Snapshot.mockJSON` deleted → checked-in fixture `Sources/CCSBarKit/Fixtures/status.json` (`.copy` resource), loaded via `Fixtures.statusJSONData()`/`Bundle.module` — the `--snapshot` render AND the decode contract test now share ONE fixture (no drift). Documented dev-only invariant (fixture never on the app hot path → `package_app.sh` omits the bundle; `Bundle.module` would fatalError there). **Two pure extractions** made finding-prone logic testable (behavior-preserving): `Theme.resetHintText(secondsRemaining:)` (split from `Date.now`) + `StatusModel.isStale(ageSeconds:refreshIntervalMs:)` (`nonisolated`, split from `staleness`). **23 tests** (all real behavior, not mock-existence): parseISO micro/plain/Zulu/garbage (the microsecond test caught that Foundation parses 6-digit fractions to ms, not the strip fallback), resetHint d/h/m boundaries, usageColor bands (75/76/94/95 + default-100), isStale 270/271 boundary + 15s floor, orderedProfiles active-first, isHealthy per liveness, SchemaProbe, fixture decode contract + leniency (missing fallback_chain→[], null tier, name+active-only, fableWeek `7d fable`/`7d fable 5`/`7d Fable` vs plain `7d` rejected). `Scripts/regen-fixture.sh` refreshes from `clauth status --json`. Acceptance: `swift test` **23/23**, `swift build` clean, `rg mockJSON Snapshot.swift` **gone**, `--snapshot=healthy` still renders (fixture via Bundle.module). Reviewed (code-reviewer): clean split, real tests, 3 findings (Bundle.module dev-only invariant comment, `try? XCTUnwrap`→`try`, exact isStale boundary) all fixed inline. |
| **TECH-4** — ccsbar daemon-liveness truth (staleness + schema gate) | ✅ done | ccsbar `632bff1` | **Tier-1 hero-TRUST** (a dead daemon must not render as fresh). `DaemonClient.readStatus` → `StatusRead` (ok/fileMissing/schemaUnsupported/decodeFailed): a `{schema}` probe runs BEFORE the full decode so a future schema bump reads as "ccsbar out of date", NOT "no daemon"; a real decode failure is logged via `os.Logger`, not swallowed. `StatusModel` gains a `Liveness` state (ok / stalled(since:) / outOfDate(schema:) / down); `reload()` computes staleness from `generated_at` age > `max(3×refresh_interval_ms, 15s)` (per spec — a file that stopped advancing is stalled even though its bytes don't change). `PanelView` renders each distinctly: a loud "Daemon stalled — data from HH:MM" banner OVER the last-known content, a separate "ccsbar out of date (schema N)" state, and the daemon-down empty state; `MenuBarLabel` dims the glyph when not live. `ProfileStatus` decodes leniently (only name+active load-bearing) for additive-era survival. Snapshot harness adds `--snapshot=stale` / `--snapshot=schema2` variants printing the resolved liveness. Acceptance: `swift build` clean; `--snapshot=stale` → `daemonStalled=true` + stale-banner PNG (visually verified), `--snapshot=schema2` → `outOfDate(schema: 2)` + out-of-date PNG (NOT "not running", visually verified), healthy → `ok` + content; `generatedAt`/`statusMtime` now live call sites (dead-helper acceptance); README stale-case claim corrected. **Also TECH-14 #31 folded in** (it makes `statusMtime` live): `reload()` mtime-gates the re-decode/republish (still recomputing liveness so ok→stalled transitions) + `timer.tolerance=1.0`. |
| **TECH-14** — hygiene sweep (Rust a/b/c ✅; Swift (d)✅ (e)✅ (f)✅) | ✅ done | `5bd4af1` + ccsbar `632bff1` (d) + `c5ad408` (e/f) | Three independent low-risk drift fixes (the Rust-repo items of the cherry-pickable batch). **(b) #23 completions drift:** added the missing user-facing subcommands (`status`, `daemon`, `doctor`, `completions`) to all three shells' first-token lists + their second-token args, and reworded the `login` description from the stale "via claude /login" to the browser-OAuth reality. Drift-guard tests assert every user-facing dispatch arm appears in bash/zsh/fish + that "claude /login" is gone. **(c) #24 macOS-semantics un-gated:** chose the finding's **option 2** (rationale, NOT `cfg(macos)` gate) because gating `classify_link_at`'s content-compare (claude.rs) and `switch_profile`'s force-relink (actions.rs) would make a non-symlink credentials file on Linux fall through to `read_link` and **error** — both branches are correct cross-platform; replaced the macOS-only comments with an explicit cross-platform rationale, existing non-gated regression tests stay green. **(a) #12 DESIGN.md:** corrected the `third_party` sample from the never-emitted `{balance_usd,currency}` to the real `{available:true}` (structured balance deferred, matches `status_json.rs:138`) + added the derived-label caveat for `windows[].label` (`7d Opus`/`7d fable` — opaque display string, not a switch key). Acceptance: `rg available docs/ccsbar/DESIGN.md` ✅, `rg 'daemon\|doctor\|status' src/completions.rs` all shells ✅ + zero `claude /login`, cross-platform rationale comments present + `cargo test` green (the non-gated Linux regression). **533 tests, clippy -D/fmt clean.** **Swift items:** (d) #31 mtime republish gate + `timer.tolerance=1.0` **DONE** (ccsbar `632bff1`, folded into TECH-4). **(e) #33 single-instance guard + (f) #42 login-item DONE** (ccsbar `c5ad408`): `SingleInstance.acquire()` refuses a second ccsbar — packaged `.app` enumerates `NSRunningApplication` by pid + `LSMultipleInstancesProhibited` (LaunchServices-enforced), bare `swift run` falls back to an advisory `flock` on `~/.clauth/ccsbar.lock` (pure `tryFlock` core, tested exclusivity+release+unavailable); `LoginItem` registers via `SMAppService.mainApp` on first launch (opt-out persisted; `.requiresApproval` counts as ON so the panel toggle doesn't snap back) surfaced as a "Start at login" toggle; README + `package_app.sh` retargeted to the auto-register reality. **Shared hardening folded into TECH-11's `Notifier`:** new `AppBundle.isMainApp` gates every system integration on the SPECIFIC app bundle id (`com.xingfanxia.ccsbar`), not "any bundle id" — `swift test` runs under the xctest tool (which HAS its own id), so the old generic guard would have fired `UNUserNotificationCenter`/`SMAppService` under test; `package_app.sh` fails the build on Info.plist↔`AppBundle.mainAppID` drift. Acceptance: `swift build` clean, `swift test` **39/39**, `rg NSRunningApplication|flock` + `SMAppService` present, README documents autostart. Reviewed (code-reviewer, opus): no CRITICAL/HIGH; **all 8 findings fixed** (LSUIElement "raise panel" overpromise→dedup-only; bundle-id drift guard; opt-out persist gated on availability; `LSMultipleInstancesProhibited`; `.requiresApproval` handling; stale package_app text; lockFD + guard-divergence comments). SMAppService/NSRunningApplication live behavior = operator acceptance (needs the packaged `.app`). **Rust LOC debt RESOLVED** (`a254a99`): extracted the pure daemon types (`ConfigOp`/`LastError`/`LastSwitch`/`SwitchBackoff` + `switch_backoff_ms`) to new `src/daemon/types.rs`, re-exported from mod — pure move, no behavior change, `mod.rs` **559→490** (under the gate), 533 tests green. |
| **TECH-12** — clauth doctor diagnostic + daemon.log rotation | ✅ done | `db48be7` | **`clauth doctor`** (new `src/doctor/` — pure `core.rs` + impure `mod.rs`): read-only health checks encoding the "why didn't it switch last night?" runbook — LaunchAgent state, code-sign identity (ad-hoc vs stable → the Always-Allow-persistence root cause), Keychain write-grant, daemon lock, control-socket `snapshot` round-trip, status.json freshness, CLI↔daemon version/schema skew. `run()` prints pass/fail + `process::exit`s non-zero on any FAIL. **Constraint-safe keychain check:** write-grant proven via a THROWAWAY `clauth-doctor-probe` item (delete-first self-heal → add → delete); the real `Claude Code-credentials` item is only ever read for presence (no `-w`, no secret, no prompt), NEVER written — respects "never touch the real item." All probes shell out via **argv (never a shell)** to absolute-path `/bin/launchctl` `/usr/bin/codesign` `/usr/bin/security`. **daemon.log rotation (#39):** launchd holds the log's `O_APPEND` fd and never reopens it, so rename orphans future writes — the only rotation that survives is an **in-place trim-to-tail** (`src/daemon/log_rotate.rs`: keep last ~1 MiB once >~5 MiB, same inode, `set_len`), called every ~5 min + at boot from the run loop (cheap stat no-ops under cap). Tests: 5 pure-core (freshness bands, skew, exit_code, `iso_to_ms` reader↔writer round-trip, render) + 3 log-trim (over-cap tail+line-boundary, under-cap no-op, absent no-op). Acceptance: `clauth --help \| grep -q doctor` ✅, `rg 'rotate' src/daemon` ✅, `cargo test doctor` 5 pass. **531 tests, clippy -D/fmt clean.** Reviewed: **security-reviewer 🟢 LOW** (throwaway isolation + argv safety confirmed; no state mutation; hero invariant safe; live-switch/prompt impossible) + **code-reviewer**; ALL findings fixed inline — **[HIGH]** freshness re-anchored to the 1s write cadence bounded by the ~60s watchdog (was wrongly keyed to `refresh_interval_ms`, up to 1h → a dead daemon could read PASS for 4h); **[MED]** `iso_to_ms` doc+test corrected to the real `+00:00` writer format (was fabricated `Z`) with a `epoch_secs_to_iso`↔`iso_to_ms` round-trip test; **[LOW]** `try_lock` distinguishes `WouldBlock` (Pass) from a real error (Warn, was false PASS); **[LOW]** header softened + probe delete-first; **[WARN/LOC]** doctor split into `core.rs` (170) + `mod.rs` (344), both < 500. Live `clauth doctor` on a real install = operator acceptance (touches launchctl/Keychain/socket). **Carry-forward debt (→ TECH-14):** `src/daemon/mod.rs` now **559 LOC** (>500) — TECH-9's boot-migrate + TECH-12's run-loop rotation wiring grew it; extract the run loop / consts or allowlist in the TECH-14 batch. |
| **TECH-10** — control-socket I/O hardening (daemon `4b80b9a` + Swift `b088e1e`) | ✅ **both halves** | `4b80b9a` + ccsbar `b088e1e` | **Daemon (Rust) half of the two-repo milestone.** `src/daemon/socket.rs`: each accepted stream now gets `set_read_timeout`/`set_write_timeout(2s)`, and `handle()` runs on a **short-lived per-connection thread** (`SocketHandles` derives `Clone` — four Arc bumps) so a slow read no longer serializes the accept loop and a `handle()` panic dies with its thread instead of killing the listener (#3/#7); the reader is bounded with `.take(64 KiB)` so a newline-less stream can't OOM the daemon. No thread cap **by design** (same-UID socket authority — a same-UID process can already read tokens; rationale encoded at the spawn site). Rust std ignores SIGPIPE → write-to-closed-peer returns Err (swallowed), no SO_NOSIGPIPE needed here (that's the Swift half). Test `hung_connection_read_timeout_does_not_block_accept_loop` (real UnixListener via `serve()` on a tempdir sock): a first connection sending no newline does **not** block a second connection's valid `switch` command — **5/5 deterministic**. Acceptance: `rg 'set_read_timeout\|set_write_timeout\|take\(' src/daemon/socket.rs` present; `cargo test read_timeout` 1 pass (NB: the plan's `cargo test 'socket.*timeout'` is a *regex* but cargo test filters by **substring** — the working invocation is `cargo test read_timeout` / `daemon::socket`). **523 tests, clippy -D/fmt clean.** Reviewed (concurrency pass, code-reviewer): no CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM — no lock-inversion with the main drain (socket never nests locks; rank stack is thread-local), cheap Arc Clone, correct `WouldBlock` drop without spin; 2 LOW/NIT (timeout-comment precision, no-cap rationale) fixed inline. **Swift half DONE** (ccsbar `b088e1e`): `DaemonClient.sendRaw` sets SO_NOSIGPIPE (write-to-closed → EPIPE not a fatal signal) + SO_RCVTIMEO/SO_SNDTIMEO 2s, loops write() until the full payload is sent, loops read() to the newline/EOF bounded 1 MiB; `StatusModel` command methods run the blocking socket I/O off @MainActor via `Task.detached` then hop back to settle (call sites stay sync — SwiftUI views untouched). `swift build` clean; `--snapshot` still renders the panel. Beach-ball-absence with a mid-switch daemon = operator-manual. |
| **TECH-11** — command-outcome feedback + observability (ccsbar) | ✅ done | ccsbar `81f6cb9` | **Errors must be loud, and a rejection must not masquerade as absence.** Daemon commands return a three-way `CommandOutcome` (`.ok` / `.daemonError(code,message)` / `.unreachable`) instead of a `Bool`: `switchTo` shell-falls-back to `clauth <name>` **only** on `.unreachable`, NEVER on a daemon rejection (which would fire the daemon-absence path against a PRESENT daemon and hide the real error). Pure `classifyReply` (unit-tested: `ok:true`→ok, `ok:false`→daemonError w/ code+message, nil/non-object/unparseable→unreachable) is split from the socket I/O. `StatusModel.run` fires the blocking socket call off `@MainActor` (`Task.detached`) then on success runs a **settle ladder** (re-read at 0.6/1.2/2.4/4.8s until `generated_at` advances AND the expected effect holds → kills the double-tap-because-nothing-changed reflex), on error surfaces a loud auto-clearing banner. `DaemonStatus` gains additive `clauth_version` / `pending_switch` / `last_switch{from,to,at,trigger}` / `last_error{at,message}` (lenient `decodeIfPresent` — an older daemon omitting them decodes to nil, not a throw). `PanelView` renders a command-error banner + a quiet footer (last-switch line + soft version-skew badge); `ConfigView` disables its controls when the daemon's unreachable. `Notifier` (bundle-id-guarded `UNUserNotification`) posts on an UNATTENDED switch + a new auto-switch error — a **true no-op** in bare `swift run`/tests (no bundle id → guarded before `.current()`), operator-verifiable only in the packaged `.app`; `maybeNotify` baseline suppresses the launch burst + the user's own tap + re-notification. Snapshot adds `--snapshot=skew` (mismatched `clauth_version` → skew badge). Acceptance: `swift build` clean; `swift test` **35/35**; `--snapshot=skew` → `skew=9.9.9` in stderr + badge; acceptance greps (`lastCommandError`/`CommandOutcome`/`daemonError`/`UNUserNotification`/`versionSkew`) present. Reviewed (code-reviewer, opus): no CRITICAL/HIGH; **all 7 MEDIUM/LOW findings fixed** — **M1** `sendRaw`→`RawReply` so a reply-TIMEOUT (daemon busy w/ a ~3s Keychain rewrite past the 2s read deadline) classifies as `.daemonError(no_reply)`, NOT `.unreachable` (was the one residual double-switch = double-logout hole); **M2** testable `switchTo(_:send:)` seam + 2 tests pinning the no-fallback-on-rejection invariant (a regression adding `case .daemonError: shellClauth` would now fail a test); **M3** `pending_switch` doc softened (decoded for forward-compat, not yet surfaced — code/doc one-source-of-truth); **M4** `daemonReachable` gates on `liveness == .ok` (reactive) so a crashed daemon w/ a stale socket file still disables controls; **M5** `switchInFlight` guard blocks concurrent double-tap switches (tiles disable mid-switch); **M6** numeric-truthy `ok` tolerance; **M7** `sun_path` length guard (refuse rather than silently connect to a truncated wrong path). **Live browser-OAuth + real two-account switch = operator-manual acceptance** (a real switch logs out every running Claude Code process). |
| **TECH-9** — secret hygiene + durable-state perms/fsync + SECURITY.md sync | ✅ done | `c07fc16` | **Redaction (#14):** new `oauth::token_parse_error` replaces both 2xx token-body parse sites (refresh + code-exchange); a 2xx body that fails to deserialize still holds live access+refresh tokens, so the error now emits only serde **category + line/column** (NOT the serde Display `{e}`, which can echo an offending scalar), HTTP status, and body length — one redacted `e` feeds last_error/status.json/daemon.log. **Perms+durability (#5/#13/#15):** `write_and_rename(path,content,mode,durable)` is the single atomic writer — temp via `create_new`+`mode` (0o600 at open, never chmod-after), fsync data before rename + best-effort parent-dir fsync after when durable; `atomic_write`/`atomic_write_600` durable, `atomic_write_600_fast` non-durable **only** for the 1/s rebuildable status.json. Write/sync-failure cleanup removes **only a temp we opened** — a concurrent same-PID `create_new` AlreadyExists propagates without deleting the winner's in-flight temp (regression caught + fixed: `sync_credentials_unlocked_concurrent…` 5/5). 0o600 on settings.json (claude.rs/runtime.rs), config.toml (normal + drift-rewrite), credentials, status.json; `mkdir_700` for ~/.clauth + profiles; daemon boot tightens a looser tree → 0o700 **and** the launchd-created daemon.log → 0o600. **Docs:** SECURITY.md data-at-rest table + Fork-surfaces reconciled with code; keychain.rs comment corrected (argv same-UID/root visible incl. EDR exec logs; no-value `-w` prompts on the **tty**, not stdin). Tests: `token_parse_error_redacts_the_2xx_body` (value-free channel: no SECRETLEAK, reports status+len+`column`), `config_toml_is_0600_including_the_drift_rewrite_path` (NaN-threshold lever forces the Err-branch rewrite), `clauth_tree_migrated_to_0700_on_boot` (0o700 tree + 0o600 daemon.log). Acceptance all green: `rg 'has no stdin' src/keychain.rs` **gone**, `rg '0700\|Keychain\|clauthd.sock' SECURITY.md` present, `atomic_write_600` at all changed sites, `cargo test token_parse_error` pass. **522 tests, clippy -D/fmt clean.** Reviewed by security-reviewer (🟢 LOW, no CRITICAL/HIGH — redaction sound, no looser-than-0600 window, fsync ordering correct) + code-reviewer (⚠️ approve-with-warnings); all findings fixed inline. All via HomeSandbox + keychain-disabled — **no real ~/.clauth / ~/.claude / Keychain touched**. **Carry-forward debt (→ TECH-14 hygiene):** `src/daemon/mod.rs` 497→524 LOC (the +10-line boot `migrate_clauth_perms_700` pushed it just over the 500 gate) — small+cohesive, decompose or allowlist in the TECH-14 batch; oauth.rs (842)/profile.rs (1025)/runtime.rs (1106) are pre-existing over-budget, untouched-in-size here. |
| **TECH-8** — switch-event observability, backoff & upgrade restart | ✅ done | `df58463` | status.json gains **additive** (SCHEMA stays 1) `clauth_version` (`env!(CARGO_PKG_VERSION)`, always present → CLI↔daemon skew detectable) + `last_switch{from,to,at,trigger}` (every executed switch/wrap-off; null single-shot). Daemon **backoff+dedup** (#38): a persistently-failing switch (keychain denial/diverged/busy) no longer logs+retries ~1/s — failure log is deduped (emit only when target/reason changes) and retries are spaced by `switch_backoff_ms` (first 2 immediate → preserves TECH-6 "lands once idle"; then 2s→4s→8s… cap 60s), gated in the drain so scan_auto_switch cadence is untouched; success clears backoff + records last_switch. `signed-install.sh` now `launchctl kickstart -k gui/$UID/com.clauth.daemon` after re-signing (#37 — reinstall no longer leaves the stale inode deciding switches until next login). Tests: `switch_backoff_ms_grows_exponentially_and_caps`, `switch_failure_backoff_dedups_log_over_many_ticks` (**≤2 log emissions over 30 ticks** on a permanently-busy target), `successful_switch_records_last_switch_event`, status_json asserts version==0.7.1 + last_switch shape. Acceptance all green: `status --json \| jq -e '.clauth_version and …'` true, version==0.7.1, `grep kickstart` present, `cargo test switch_failure_backoff` pass. 519 tests, clippy -D/fmt clean. SCHEMA not bumped; ccsbar untouched (TECH-11 consumes). |
| **TECH-7** — cross-process state RMW atomicity (lost-update) | ✅ done | `3bc823e` | New `profile::update_app_state(delta)` reads-modifies-writes `AppState` **inside** the state flock (reload disk → apply narrow delta → write merged), so two writers touching different fields commute. Converted the cross-process racers to deltas: `finish_switch`/`switch_off` own only `active_profile`; fallback chain primitives own only `fallback_chain`/`wrap_off` (move recomputes position on the disk chain, not a stale swap); `capture_into_profile` (login) owns its profile entry + `auth_broken` and adopts active **only if disk has none** (never clobbers a concurrent switch). `set_threshold` untouched (writes config.toml). Daemon holds the flock **across** the switch AND the post-write `app_state_mtime()` read (re-entrant `with_state_lock`), closing the :354 self-adoption window. Tests (daemon_mod, HomeSandbox + keychain-disabled — no real creds): `cargo test lost_update` = switch from a stale snapshot **preserves an externally-appended profile**; `cargo test rmw` = daemon adopts its own write's mtime (no spurious reload) yet still reloads a later external write — **both pass**. 516 tests, clippy -D/fmt clean. Residual (documented): rename/delete/create_blank/reorder keep blind save_app_state (TUI-single-process dominant, outside the CLI-login/switch vector); TUI↔daemon chain-edit race is the R3 deferral. **Manual smoke (operator, touches real Keychain):** concurrent `clauth login C` + threshold-forced auto-switch leaves C in `status --json \| jq '.profiles'`. |
| **TECH-6** — pending_switch queue correctness + last_error | ✅ done | `84f8815` | `pending_switch` HashSet→ordered `VecDeque<PendingSwitchEntry{target,origin:User\|Scheduler,retry_until}>`. Fixes finding #4 (≡#6≡#9): (1) a busy/diverged/transient target is **re-queued** (120s TTL from the ack) instead of dropped after one attempt — a user tap during a fetch window no longer evaporates post-`{ok:true}`; (2) precedence is deterministic — `enqueue_pending_switch` clears queued Scheduler targets on a User request, `select_switch_winner` makes User outrank Scheduler (last-writer-wins) at drain time (both enqueue- and drain-side). Additive `status.json` `last_error{at,message}` records every skip/fail (**SCHEMA stays 1**; `clauth status --json \| jq -e 'has("last_error")'` → true, null in single-shot). `cargo test daemon::tests` **8 pass** incl. the 3 acceptance tests `busy_target_requeued_not_dropped` / `user_switch_outranks_same_tick_auto` / `user_switch_clears_queued_scheduler`; daemon_status_json pins the last_error shape. TUI drain + 2 construction sites adapted (type-forced; TUI carries only scheduler targets → behavior preserved). NOT bumped SCHEMA; scan_auto_switch stays level-triggered; leaf-drain-then-config-lock preserved. `rg HashSet src/daemon/mod.rs src/usage/scheduler.rs` shows no pending_switch HashSet. 514 tests, clippy -D/fmt clean. All via HomeSandbox + keychain-disabled — no real creds touched. |

## Next
- **ccsbar is built + shipped** at `~/projects/devtools/ccsbar`
  (github.com/xingfanxia/ccsbar). Runnable via `swift run` or the packaged
  `.app`; reads the R1–R6 + CBAR-2 contract, needs no more clauth changes for v1.
- **Operator acceptance for upstream (asked in uwuclxdy/clauth#1 + PR #19):**
  on current upstream `mommy` (or this fork post-`387607f`): (1) `clauth login
  <tmp>` end-to-end browser flow, (2) one `t` force-rotate on the minted
  profile — proves a `platform.claude.com`-minted pair refreshes at
  `api.anthropic.com` (upstream's one open question), (3) a `clauth <name>`
  switch with a bare `claude` picking up the new account. All three touch the
  real Keychain/browser → manual, per the security constraints.
- **Rotation-coherence: FIRED + FIXED 2026-07-07**, hardened through review
  round 2 (2026-07-11). Correctness = adopt + mirror-on-rotate; the
  ahead-of-expiry rotate is now the opt-in `preemptive_rotation` toggle —
  **enabled in the live profiles.toml on this machine** (upstream default off).
- **Contribute-back review round 2 DONE (2026-07-11):** uwuclxdy requested
  changes on both PRs; all findings addressed + replied.
  - [#24](https://github.com/uwuclxdy/clauth/pull/24) `95d6928`+`296216a`:
    `preemptive_rotation` opt-in (off by default, Config-tab row),
    README reframed around adoption, `apply_rotated_tokens_locked` captures
    mirror creds under the flock but runs the `security` shell-out AFTER
    release (never hold the state flock across a subprocess),
    `try_adopt_live_rotation` takes a `&RotationGuard` proof-of-lock param
    (scheduler acquires the guard at rotation-leg entry), adopt tests
    un-gated from cfg(macos), doc-link fix.
  - [#25](https://github.com/uwuclxdy/clauth/pull/25) `ef75932`+`43e0887`+`5f6edd6`:
    terminal-400 double-spend guard (`fresher_disk_pair` re-read under the
    guard; only an unchanged-store 400 quarantines), 403→Transient unless the
    body confirms `invalid_grant`, `ensure_installable` gate on EVERY switch
    entry (`switch_profile_noninteractive` takes ConfigHandle+refresher; TUI
    gets a flag-only synchronous refusal), and — pre-push self-review catch —
    the carry LIFTS a stale quarantine (`carry_external_rotation`), else a
    recovered account stays excluded forever.
  - [#26](https://github.com/uwuclxdy/clauth/pull/26) **APPROVED** (he fixes
    two stale doc lines himself at merge).
  - All ported to fork main (`be8b1de`, `583af22`, `8669847`, `3256f3c`) and
    deployed. Worktrees: `scratchpad/wt-coherence`, `scratchpad/wt-auth1`.
- **Contribute-back round 4 OPEN (2026-07-11):** issue
  [#29](https://github.com/uwuclxdy/clauth/issues/29) (divergence UX) + PR
  [#30](https://github.com/uwuclxdy/clauth/pull/30) (retry-after:0 backoff)
  + PR [#31](https://github.com/uwuclxdy/clauth/pull/31) (non-blocking
  divergence, fixes #29) — both cut from upstream/mommy v0.9.0. Worktrees:
  `scratchpad/wt-up-backoff`, `scratchpad/wt-up-diverge` (session tmp).
- **Issue #27 ANSWERED YES (2026-07-11):** uwuclxdy wants the minimal daemon
  (usage-refresh + auto-switch + logging), fears conflicts/TUI-only flows;
  design reply posted (no new mutation paths, refuse-and-log on anything
  interactive, timestamped logs). **Daemon PR (and TECH-15 riding on it) is
  now actionable — after #24/#25 land** (it builds on their machinery).
- **INCIDENT 2026-07-10 evening (attributed via TECH-15 timestamps):** ax-main
  (11:15Z) and ax-backup (17:06Z) quarantined by the classic double-spend
  (CC rotated the shared chain first; the old binary had no carry guard —
  exactly the #25 round-2 fix); a TUI switch toward ax-cl at 19:49Z
  half-landed (live symlink moved to ax-cl, state kept active=ax-main) →
  phantom "DIFFERENT account" divergence wedged auto-switch all evening; the
  open TUI's whole-state blind saves (the known TECH-7 residual) kept
  resurrecting stale `auth_broken` entries (all three flagged at once with no
  daemon-side transition line). Resolved overnight by AX: `clauth login`
  re-auths for ax-cl (09:12Z) + ax-backup (10:04Z), daemon switched to ax-cl
  (09:29Z), state/symlink consistent again. Remaining: **ax-main stays
  quarantined** — its chain's live continuation was lost when the Keychain
  was overwritten by later switches; needs a manual `clauth login ax-main`.
  Follow-up candidates: convert the TUI's remaining blind `save_app_state`
  writers to `update_app_state` deltas (TECH-7 residual is no longer
  theoretical), and snapshot-before-walk-away so a flagged active's live pair
  isn't orphaned by the AUTH-4 switch.
- **INCIDENT 2026-07-11 afternoon (same family, new episode):** AX re-logged
  Claude Code itself into ax-main (~15:00 PDT) while clauth's state still said
  active=ax-cl → every TUI open got blocked by the DIVERGENCE modal ("live ≠
  ax-cl", all three options wrong for this case). Root causes underneath:
  (1) ax-cl's chain had already died at 17:07Z — the 4.5-min preemptive lead
  (interval*3, 90 s cadence) fired INSIDE Claude Code's own ~5-min refresh
  margin, lost the race, 400d with the store unchanged → correct quarantine,
  but the fresh chain lived only in the unreadable Keychain and was orphaned.
  (2) No path recognizes "the diverged live login belongs to a SIBLING
  profile" (candidate improvement — the divergence flow could offer "this is
  ax-main; switch bookkeeping to it"). Resolution (agent, 15:12–15:25 PDT):
  killed the stale TUIs, corrected `active_profile` → ax-main (bookkeeping
  catch-up — CC was already there; no Keychain/live-file writes), hand-adopted
  CC's fresher same-chain pair into ax-main's store (identity-verified against
  the anchor, atomic rename — the mechanical equivalent of
  `try_adopt_live_rotation`, which wouldn't have run until the 18:25 PDT
  rotation window), relaunched a fresh TUI in the tmux pane. Verified: no
  divergence/deferral lines post-restart, active=ax-main auth ok.
- **FIX for the "re-login every other day" instability (`e47f723`, deployed
  2026-07-11 15:23 PDT):** `ACTIVE_ROTATE_LEAD_FLOOR_MS` 3 min → **15 min**
  (fork divergence from upstream's #24-settled 3-min floor, justified by the
  17:07Z race loss above). The whole death spiral was: lead inside CC's
  margin → lose race → 400 → quarantine → AUTH-4 walks away → switch
  overwrites Keychain → the chain's only fresh copy gone → re-login. A 15-min
  lead makes clauth decisively the chain's last writer; adopt + carry remain
  the backstops. Consider proposing upstream later with this incident as
  evidence (their toggle default-off makes it lower-stakes there).
  Still open for AX: `clauth login ax-cl` to revive ax-cl (chain dead for
  real); ax-main/ax-backup healthy.
- **RateLimited mystery SOLVED (2026-07-11 ~15:35 PDT) — R3 priority UP:**
  ax-main + ax-backup pinned at `RateLimited` while CC's own `/usage` worked
  and ax-cl (freshly re-logged) fetched 200 in the SAME tick from the SAME
  IP. Probe confirmed: per-ACCOUNT 429 (`retry-after: 0`) on
  `/api/oauth/usage`. Cause: **every open TUI runs its own full scheduler**
  (`tui/app.rs:1553`, the documented R3 deferral) — daemon + two stale TUIs =
  2–3× the 90 s cadence per account for days, draining Anthropic's
  per-account polling quota; ax-cl escaped because its dead token wasn't
  consuming quota during the heavy window. Killed the extra TUIs (single
  poller = the daemon now); buckets refill passively. **R3 (TUI defers to a
  running daemon and reads status.json instead of polling) is no longer just
  a race concern — it has a hard API-quota justification now.** Also worth
  citing in the upstream daemon PR (#27): shipping a daemon without R3 gives
  every daemon+TUI user this same quota burn. Note: ccsbar numbers during a
  429 window are CACHED (stale reset times/utilization) — the "ax-main resets
  in 55m vs CC says 5:50pm" confusion was staleness, not a wrong account.
- **DIVERGE-1 SHIPPED (2026-07-11 ~16:00 PDT, `0e17845`):** the divergence
  flow no longer blocks the TUI (1Hz poll + startup raise a non-blocking
  banner; <kbd>d</kbd> opens the resolver; switch-shaped actions still raise
  it), the resolver identifies the live login's OWNER
  (`identify_live_login_owner`: exact token match, else `~/.claude.json`
  uuid vs the profile's anchor) and leads with "switch to '<owner>'"
  (reusing AdoptDivergence), and the DAEMON follows CC to a sibling
  unattended when ownership is proven at the adopt bar (token equality or
  network-verified uuid vs anchor; `follow_live_login` tick step) — the fix
  for both wedges this week. Adopt refusal logs fingerprint-deduped.
  Upstream: issue #29 + PR [#31](https://github.com/uwuclxdy/clauth/pull/31)
  (TUI part, token-tier only — the uuid tier follows once #24's anchors
  land). ccsbar: nothing to change (it reads status.json; benefits
  automatically from the daemon self-heal).
- **RATE-1: the "pinned RateLimited forever" root cause (`b9575ac`,
  deployed 2026-07-11 15:58 PDT, recovery confirmed 16:02):** the usage
  endpoint answers EVERY 429 with `retry-after: 0` and its sliding window
  counts rejected requests; `next_slot_deferral` honored the 0 verbatim
  (the exponential ladder only engaged for a MISSING header), so once an
  account crossed the limit (daemon + two stale TUIs = 3× polling for a
  day — every open TUI runs a full scheduler, the R3 deferral) it re-polled
  at cadence and never drained. Fix: deferral = max(hint, interval +
  ladder) on a 429. Live proof: ax-main/ax-backup pinned RateLimited for
  ~50 min through restarts, went Fresh 4 minutes after the deploy.
  Upstream: same bug verbatim in v0.9.0 — PR [#30](https://github.com/uwuclxdy/clauth/pull/30).
  Also noted there: v0.9.0's clean-base `runtime::tests` fail-alive flake is
  hot under parallel load (2/3 full-suite runs on this machine; serial =
  green) — hardening for two of the tests rides #24/#25. **Root-cause lead
  (port-agent finding, 2026-07-11):** the tests use hardcoded fake PIDs
  (11111/22222/33333, 12345) that can collide with REAL processes on a busy
  machine, plus same-process flock re-acquisition in `is_session_alive`'s
  probe — explains both the load-correlation and the random-member-per-run
  signature. Proper fix (follow-up, not the settled-poll bandage): unique
  per-test fake PIDs guaranteed dead, or a probe seam. Applies to fork AND
  upstream.
- **Deploy shape CHANGED (2026-07-10 ~21:31 PDT):** the daemon now runs as the
  `com.clauth.daemon` LaunchAgent (KeepAlive — `pkill` respawns it; that IS
  the restart path after `cargo install`). Memory updated.
- **Follow-ups:** S7 (Settings window + Sparkle auto-update + Developer-ID signing/
  notarization + Homebrew cask), daemon R3 (TUI↔daemon scheduler coordination).
- **Upstream v0.9.0 MERGED into fork main (2026-07-11, `1a30a04`):** 25
  upstream commits — tokens-dashboard TUI wave, `start [--isolated]`
  semantics (shared delegate default, isolated opt-in), string polish
  ("login" verb everywhere; feature-coverage pins "Log in an account"),
  `http_error()` body-capping in oauth, and our own #26 (weekly cap)
  landing upstream. 9 conflict files resolved keep-fork-features /
  adopt-upstream-polish (TECH-9 hardened writes kept with lowercase
  messages; RefreshError split kept, both arms now route through
  `http_error()`; fork subcommands + `--new` kept in usage/completions;
  DivergenceAction kept in modals; README keeps fork bullets with the
  post-#26 last-resort wording). 773 tests green. Installed (`clauth
  0.9.0`) + daemon respawned on it; all three profiles auth=ok/Fresh.
- **PRs #24/#25 updated to v0.9.0 (2026-07-11, `2c0cc53`/`c311201`):** the
  release made both CONFLICTING/DIRTY; merged `mommy` into each branch
  (merge, not rebase — review anchors preserved, matches upstream's own
  merge-commit style). #24: README + usage re-export union (647 green).
  #25: RefreshError × http_error reconciliation + README union (663
  green). Both MERGEABLE again, CI green/pending; update comments posted.
  #30/#31 were already cut from v0.9.0 — untouched, still CLEAN. The 25
  new upstream commits contain NO independent fix for #30's backoff hole
  or #31's divergence UX — both PRs remain necessary.
- **INCIDENT 2026-07-12 00:08Z — cross-profile credential copy (root-caused
  same hour via TECH-15 timestamps + token-hash forensics):** post-23:31Z
  auto-switch to ax-backup, a running claude's own refresh wrote its
  (ax-main's) rotated pair back over the live Keychain+mirror; an
  identity-blind live→store capture then copied that foreign pair into
  ax-backup's store (its anchor untouched since Jul 10 — store/anchor
  split-brain), leaving ax-main+ax-backup polling ONE account → the
  "RateLimited 还没解决" pin AX screenshotted (identical windows to the
  second across both rows was the tell). The daemon's own 00:08:03 follow +
  00:08:19 switch were identity-correct (verified against every mtime/hash).
  Remediation: CAP-1 (below) + **AX must `clauth login ax-backup`** to
  re-mint its real account (old chain unrecoverable — overwritten).
  **DIRECTION CORRECTED 2026-07-12 (post-relogin /profile forensics):** the
  double-polled account is xiaxbackup@gmail.com — so the profile that LOST
  its own account is **ax-main** (its real account = the orphan; its
  pre-incident anchor d0ab…, written Jul 11 09:29Z, was truthful), not
  ax-backup. AX's 02:24Z `clauth login ax-backup` browser re-login therefore
  landed CORRECTLY (browser session was the backup account) — but left
  ax-main still holding backup-account credentials. Outstanding manual step:
  browser → log into the MAIN account → `clauth login ax-main`.
- **CAP-1 shipped (2026-07-12, `9f43ed1`):** (1) snapshot_active_credentials
  decides and writes on ONE read (closes the classify→re-read capture
  window); (2) every sanctioned capture moves the identity anchor with the
  store (claude.json hint) or DROPS a stale anchor (hourly /profile backfill
  re-proves); (3) daemon duplicate-login tripwire (memoized logline naming
  the pair — fired on the live box at 00:33:54Z naming ax-main/ax-backup
  within seconds of deploy); (4) follow_live_login logline whitespace fix.
  787 tests (+6). Upstream: the capture TOCTOU + anchor coherence hole is
  upstream code too, but the anchor layer arrives with PR #24 — raise after
  #24 lands (fold into the daemon PR or its own).
- **TOK-1..5 tokens feed shipped (2026-07-12):** clauth `e047779` — daemon
  publishes machine-wide `~/.clauth/tokens.json` (schema 1; today/week/month/
  lifetime, raw four-bucket splits + in_out headline + per-model rows capped
  8 with "others" fold + LiteLLM cost with floor flags; pure
  tokens::build_tokens_snapshot shared TUI/daemon; worker reuses
  tokens::spawn+pricing::spawn, cfg(not(test))-gated; contract pinned in
  docs/ccsbar/DESIGN.md §3 + SECURITY.md). ccsbar `176a730` — TokensStrip
  above StatusStrip (collapsed one-liner "Tokens today 41.2M · $12.40",
  hover expands in-place period table + top-3 models; neutral palette; own
  schema gate + additive decode; reads inside the existing 4s poll on its
  own mtime gate; 167 tests; light/dark snapshots verified). Adversarial
  review: clauth 0 findings; ccsbar 1 low (abbreviateCount 4-sig-fig band
  crossing) fixed + pinned. Live verify: tokens.json in 17s post-deploy
  (today $169 / lifetime 93.7B total, month floor correct), ccsbar decode
  clean, TUI relaunched on the CAP-1 binary.
- **TOK-6 display-basis fix (2026-07-12, ccsbar):** AX flagged the strip as
  "severely wrong" ("today 1.03M · $319" — ~$310/MTok). Root cause: TOK-4
  headlined `in_out` (cache-EXCLUDED) next to a cost that always prices
  cache; with 1h-TTL caching, cache_read was 306.7M of that day's 316M true
  total (in_out = 0.34%). Fix in ccsbar only (feed already carried `total`):
  strip now renders cache-inclusive `displayTokens` = max(total, in_out)
  (per-model rows sum the four buckets client-side, saturating), decorated
  `N+` when `complete`/`split_complete` is false, mirroring `"$X+"`; models
  basis keys on the same count. DESIGN.md §tokens.json field semantics
  updated in the same batch. Feed and schema unchanged.
- **CAP-2 anchor provenance + same-account tripwire (2026-07-12):** the
  incident's SECOND recurrence vector, found live: (a) `clauth login`
  probed the fresh token's account uuid and wrote the anchor, but the
  capture then re-anchored from CC's live-login hint — an UNRELATED
  account (whatever was live during the login) — clobbering the
  authoritative probe (observed: ax-backup's anchor read ax-cl's uuid
  minutes after a correct re-login). Fix: `CaptureIdentity` provenance on
  `CaptureSnapshot` — `Known(uuid)` (browser-mint, probed; the uuid rides
  the snapshot and wins), `LiveLogin` (bytes came from live; hint stays
  correct), `Unknown` (TUI re-login flow, unprobed; drop the stale anchor,
  first-fetch backfill seeds truth). (b) the CAP-1 tripwire only paired
  byte-identical tokens — blind to two DIFFERENT chains minted for one
  account (this incident's actual end state); added
  `duplicate_account_pairs` (anchor-equality, whitespace-blank guarded)
  with its own logline, memoized jointly, token-pairs filtered out to
  avoid double reporting. 791 tests (+4: probed-anchor-beats-live-hint,
  unprobed-drop, fresh-capture-Known, anchor-pair detector). Polluted live
  anchors (ax-main stale d0ab, ax-backup wrong 14d0) dropped by hand —
  backfill re-seeds truthfully. Upstream: rides the same future CAP PR as
  CAP-1 (anchor layer lands with #24).
- **ccu shipped (2026-07-12, github.com/xingfanxia/ccu `f856673`):** AX's
  mobile-mosh usage ask pivoted from "responsive TUI layout" to a
  standalone read-only terminal viewer over the daemon's published
  status.json + tokens.json (zero upstream surface — the third client of
  the publish-render pattern after ccsbar). Rust/ratatui, narrow-first
  (~44-col phone portrait over mosh; bars absorb width, tier drops before
  the state badge, <24 cols drops bars), per-account windows + countdowns
  + badges + forecast + machine tokens (TOK-6 cache-inclusive rule
  honored from day one), mtime-gated auto-refresh, schema-gated additive
  decode, formatter pins shared with ccsbar. 21 tests; installed as
  `ccu`; live-verified at 44 cols against the real feeds.
- **CAP-2 + ccu adversarial review (2026-07-12, workflow, 11/11 findings
  confirmed and ALL fixed same-day):** clauth — anchor-file reads lifted
  out of the config lock (duplicate_account_pairs now takes a
  names-snapshot; slow disk can't hold rank-Config against the fetchers),
  two-blank-anchor fixture actually locks the is_empty guard,
  account_only_pairs extracted pure + tested (token pair reports once).
  ccu — `width - 24` usize-underflow PANIC on malformed status below 24
  cols (debug profile) fixed by routing EVERY free-text row through
  trunc(.., width); stale/missing/schema-gap/forecast/tokens rows all
  width-capped; header drops the version tag before overflowing; panic
  hook restores raw-mode/alt-screen before printing; scroll clamp
  saturates instead of `as u16` wrap. Width-invariant test now sweeps all
  5 feed states × widths 20-120. clauth 792 tests (+1), ccu 21.
- **CDX-0 Codex-support feasibility researched, build DEFERRED
  (2026-07-12):** full research + staged design preserved in
  `docs/codex-support/feasibility.md` — start there before any CDX work
  (zero re-research needed). Verdict: feasible; 5h/7d windows + auth.json
  + CODEX_HOME + session-JSONL token_count map 1:1 onto clauth concepts,
  BUT hot-swap is structurally impossible on Codex (in-memory AuthManager
  + account_id-guarded reload) → CDX auto-switch must be session-boundary
  semantics. Usage source is passive-only (JSONL rate_limits snapshots;
  backend `wham/usage` polling is the community-documented ToS-risk path,
  excluded by design). Refresh rotation harsher than Anthropic
  (single-use + `refresh_token_reused` detection) but the existing
  adopt/auth_broken discipline transfers. Proposed CDX-1..4 milestones +
  non-goals in the doc. Codex source read at openai/codex `9e552e9`.
  *Follow-up (2026-07-12, later session): the usage-DISPLAY slice shipped
  in **ccu** (`src/codex.rs`, direct session-JSONL tail-reads) — AX chose
  to keep clauth Claude-scoped; all CDX milestones here stay deferred.
  See the status note atop `docs/codex-support/feasibility.md`.*
- **RESOLUTION (2026-07-12):** AX ran the browser `clauth login ax-main`
  (claude.com on the MAIN account) — probe-anchored by the CAP-2 binary
  back to its pre-incident uuid (d0ab…). All three anchors distinct,
  windows diverged (ax-main fresh at 5h=1%), both tripwires silent. The
  credential triple-swap saga is closed.
- **CAP-3 account-email surfacing + same-account login block
  (2026-07-12, AX ask):** "显示每个profile实际linked的account email …
  加一层dedup … block 防止误添加". (a) the `/profile` probe + backfill now
  carry `email` beside the uuid (`AccountIdentity`,
  `ACCOUNT_EMAIL_CACHE_FILE` — written/dropped in lockstep with the uuid
  anchor by login captures, `refresh_account_anchor` (claude.json
  `emailAddress` hint), and the hourly seed). (b) `clauth login` REFUSES
  (pre-write, side-effect-free — the minted tokens are discarded) when
  the fresh account is already held by a SIBLING profile:
  `actions::account_owner` (uuid authoritative, cached-email
  case-insensitive fallback); re-login of the holder itself stays a
  refresh. (c) surfaced on every reader: `status.json` additive
  `account_email` (schema 1; DESIGN.md field doc + consumers note), TUI
  Setup tab `account` row (cursor-profile cache read in build_snap),
  ccsbar detail card + row tooltip (fixture + decode pins), ccu profile
  line, and the same-account tripwire logline now names the email. Live
  caches primed from authoritative probes (ax-cl=x@computelabs.ai,
  ax-main=xingfanxia@gmail.com, ax-backup=xiaxbackup@gmail.com); all
  three surfaces verified live. clauth 793 / ccsbar 174 / ccu 21 tests.
- **CAP-3 adversarial review (2026-07-12, workflow, 5/5 findings confirmed
  and ALL fixed same-day):** (1) double-hold wedge — account_owner now
  treats "the minted account == exclude's own anchor" as a refresh (never
  refused), so recovering a double-hold isn't circular; a THIRD profile
  is still refused (test matrix extended). (2) drop_account_anchor drops
  email BEFORE uuid (a torn drop leaves the harmless uuid-only state) and
  seed_identity_anchor drops a predating email when seeding a fresh uuid
  (torn-drop survivor can't pair with a new account). (3)
  refresh_account_anchor reads BOTH halves from one ~/.claude.json read
  (live_oauth_account_pair) — two reads could straddle a rewrite. (4)
  status.json gates account_email on is_oauth(), matching the TUI (an
  OAuth→API conversion keeps the cached anchor; stale email must not
  surface — ccsbar/ccu inherit the fix through the feed). (5) ccsbar
  VoiceOver row label now carries the email (tooltip parity). clauth 795
  tests (+2), ccsbar 174.

- **CAP-3 follow-up: email on Overview + Usage pages, ccsbar row caption
  (2026-07-11, AX ask):** AX wanted the linked email visible on the TUI
  Overview and Usage pages and in ccsbar's account list (like ccu).
  Usage detail header gains an `account` row between `plan` and `status`
  (rendered from `HeaderState.account_email` — no IO in the line
  builder). Overview gains an `email` column carved ONLY from the width
  left over after every upstream column is at full size (never shrinks a
  column; layouts without it stay bit-identical to upstream for rebase
  friendliness); ccsbar AccountRow gains a dim caption under the name.
  Two traps found live: `section_box` pads 1 col each side (pane 50 →
  inner 46), and upstream's `fixed_overview_width` omits TIMER_SLOT(5) —
  the first carve consumed that phantom spare and clipped the 5h column;
  fixed by carving from real spare (`total - base - TIMER_SLOT`) while
  ungranted layouts keep upstream's verbatim gap math. Upstream quirk
  observed, left untouched: `fixed_split` silently drops one char with
  no ellipsis when a string is exactly width+1 ("Max 20x" → "Max 20").
  Grant threshold for the live roster ≈ pane 57; narrower panes read the
  email on the Usage tab (any width) or ccu. Adversarial review
  (workflow, 6/6 confirmed findings fixed, 1 refuted): em-dash
  placeholder now means "OAuth anchor pending" only (api-key/provider
  rows render blank — every other surface omits the field); per-frame
  N-file disk IO replaced by a tick-gated cache (`App::overview_emails`,
  ~2s reload); DESIGN.md consumer list updated; tautological em-dash
  test rewritten as count-deltas vs the no-column layout; grant
  boundary (51→0, 52→ACCOUNT_MIN), ACCOUNT_MAX cap + gap overflow, and
  rendered-row-fits-width all pinned. clauth 799 tests (+4), ccsbar 174.

- **UPSTREAM GREEN LIGHT + contribute-back batch (2026-07-12):** upstream
  merged ALL five open PRs (#24 #25 #26 #30 #31), released v0.9.1, and
  uwuclxdy answered #27: **yes to (a) daemon loop + (b) status feed, hold
  (c) socket/fallback_config**, with conditions — spec-first review of the
  status.json contract, TUI-stands-down-when-daemon-lives (R3) before the
  daemon PR lands, keep `.agent/`/`docs/ccsbar/`/`media/` out of the diff.
  His review also flagged two fork bugs + one race; ALL addressed this
  session: (1) socket `snapshot` embedded pretty JSON in the
  newline-delimited protocol (line-readers got truncated JSON) → reply
  re-serialized compact, test fixture now real to_vec_pretty (6c675dc);
  (2) SECURITY.md still described pre-#21 `security -w` argv → stdin
  `security -i` (b74fad5); (3) pre-RotationGuard token-snapshot race in
  ensure_installable (stale snapshot spends a sibling-rotated single-use
  token → healthy login wrongly quarantined) → refresh leg split into
  gate_under_guard, no token args, authoritative re-read under the guard
  (c54878a; upstream port = PR #34). Plus two upstream PRs from this
  session's own finds, both red-test-proven on mommy: **#32** fixed_split
  off-by-one (value exactly width+1 silently drops a char, no ellipsis —
  fork ca85d4e) and **#33** overview gap widening from the
  TIMER_SLOT-undercounted base overflows the row and clips the 5h "%"
  (fork b49810b; supersedes the "left untouched" note in the CAP-3
  follow-up row above). **Spec posted on #27** (status.json field table +
  additive-evolution rule + `status --json` single-shot; account_email
  explicitly flagged fork-only) — daemon PR waits on his contract review.
  Deployed: daemon PID 2383 + TUI on the 4-fix binary. clauth 807 tests.
  **NEXT MILESTONE — R3 (TUI stands down when a daemon is live):** probe
  singleton flock + status.json freshness, stop own fetch scheduling,
  re-arm on daemon death; precondition for the daemon PR, also kills the
  stale-TUI 429 amplification (RateLimited mystery row above). **FORK
  SYNC NEEDED:** upstream/mommy has 33 commits the fork lacks (quarantine
  polling backoff e7387de/5a9648f, divergence-banner-via-system-banner
  bc521cc, gate `flagged`-overrides-clock semantics the fork's
  ensure_installable does NOT yet have, v0.9.1) — schedule a merge/rebase
  before the daemon PR so the port starts from a synced base.

- **2026-07-12 (evening) — SYNC-1 + R3 + daemon PR batch.** All three
  blockers from the previous row cleared in order. **SYNC-1** (387865d):
  merged upstream/mommy v0.9.1 — 18 conflicted files. Kept fork-side:
  daemon module + queue machinery, CAP identity layer, TECH-7
  update_app_state deltas, TECH-15 logline, two-tier
  identify_live_login_owner, 15-min ACTIVE_ROTATE_LEAD_FLOOR (900_000 —
  upstream still 180_000; incident rationale comment restored verbatim).
  Took upstream: gate `flagged`-overrides-clock (folded into the fork's
  PR-#34 re-read-under-guard structure — fork now runs the merged form),
  quarantine polling backoff, rotation_bail_context (429 context survives
  a failed unmask), adopt-on-any-refresh-failure, active-profile gate
  exemption in CLI/noninteractive switch, config-sourced expiry in the
  rotate leg, divergence-banner-via-system-banner. collect_tokens is now
  ONE definition in scheduler.rs taking &AppConfig (upstream had grown a
  second copy in app.rs; fork's daemon copy missed the new auth_broken
  field — the compile caught it). 831→839 tests.
  **R3** (6dce76b): daemon::probe::daemon_is_live = singleton flock HELD
  + status.json generated_at < 30s (window rides above the 20s keychain
  kill deadline). scheduler standdown_probe gate — TUI true / daemon
  false (self-probe would deadlock on its own flock); standdown_tick
  hydrates stores from the daemon's disk caches via try_seed_cache,
  republishes countdowns off cache mtimes, drains forced names + clears
  Queued marks, skips fetch/rotate/scan. finish_bootstrap's startup
  one-shot also defers to a live daemon. 8 new tests.
  **Nits** (237d9b9): watchdog spawn .ok() → loud logline; shutting_down
  documented as deliberately never-set by the daemon.
  **Daemon PR opened as DRAFT** (branch pr/daemon-status-feed, worktree
  port off mommy b530b54): (a)+(b) exactly — daemon loop + status.json +
  status --json + stand-down + logline; NO socket / tokens.json /
  follow_live_login / config ops / forecast / account_email /
  last_switch / last_error / clauth_version (all listed in the PR body as
  additive candidates); drain adapted to upstream's HashSet
  PendingSwitch with the 120s TTL moved into SwitchBackoff.retry_until;
  docs/daemon.md carries the #27 contract verbatim. 733 tests on the
  branch. Draft honors his spec-first order — flips to ready on contract
  sign-off. PRs #32/#33/#34 checked: zero comments yet, all three already
  based on mommy tip (no rebase needed).

- **2026-07-12 (late evening) — daemon PR #35 opened (draft) + review round.**
  Two independent adversarial reviews on the port before opening: 1 HIGH
  (profile_json claimed mcp/daemon/CLI share one shape but the port left
  mcp's private copies — fork had already consolidated; hunk carried
  over) + 3 LOW (orphaned test comments; wrong rank-rationale comment in
  write_status; backoff gate ignored retry_until at the window's edge —
  fixed on BOTH sides, fork ad3e287) + doc acknowledgements (30s probe
  window vs 60s watchdog overlap; third_party null-when-never-probed).
  Two live-deploy catches, both fixed fork (8a1a9d8, 6dc3f5c) + PR: the
  stand-down transition logline painted over the ratatui screen (now
  gated off live terminals), and bootstrap's cache-due Queued pre-marks
  spun forever under stand-down (standdown_tick now sweeps all Queued
  marks; in-flight kinds survive). **PR #35 (DRAFT)**
  https://github.com/uwuclxdy/clauth/pull/35 — flips to ready on his #27
  contract sign-off. Deployed: daemon PID 134 + TUI on 6dc3f5c; live
  stand-down verified (3 rows daemon-fed countdowns, no spinner, no
  bleed). Fork 840 tests / PR branch 735.
  **OPERATOR ACTION NEEDED (CAP-1 tripwire, daemon.log 13:57Z):**
  'ax-cl' and 'ax-main' are anchored to the SAME ACCOUNT
  (xingfanxia@gmail.com) under different tokens — a wrong-account
  re-login; they double-poll one account. Recovery is a manual browser
  `clauth login <the-one-that-lost-its-account>` with the browser logged
  into that account (AX-manual per security constraints).

- **2026-07-12 (night) — ax-main auth_broken episode: forensics + the
  display fix trio.** AX's relogin healed both accounts (14:53Z fresh
  chain, flag cleared, daemon switched back). Forensics: the flag was
  set by a NON-daemon process (no transition line in daemon.log after
  07-10; mark_auth_broken always logs transitions) — the only other
  poller alive was last night's OLD-binary TUI, whose loglines paint
  into the ratatui screen and vanish. Mechanism: after the 12:50Z switch
  to ax-main its single-use chain had three players (daemon + old TUI +
  live claude); a losing racer spent a superseded token → 400 →
  correctly quarantined; the 13:07Z CC login into ax-cl orphaned
  ax-main's winning chain (lived only in CC, mirror overwritten) → only
  a browser relogin could recover. All three enabling holes were ALREADY
  closed by today's deploy (R3 single-scheduler, flagged gate, TECH-7
  narrow writes). NEW finding fixed everywhere: a dead login DISPLAYED
  as "RateLimited" (the 429 mask outranked the broken state on every
  surface) — ccsbar row badge is now a worded danger pill + fetch-status
  text suppressed while broken (3be62b5); ccu badge order broken-first +
  regression test (ead7b34); clauth TUI gained a system-banner tier
  naming the broken member + recovery command, previously INVISIBLE
  outside a switch toast (d8ad828). clauth 841 tests / ccu 22 / ccsbar
  suites green; all deployed (daemon PID 13454). The stale-anchor scare
  ("ax-cl+ax-main same account") was this morning's pre-guard label
  residue, not real token mixing — all three anchors verified distinct
  and correct after AX's relogins.

- **2026-07-12 (evening) — SYNC-2 + the RateLimited-freshness root fix +
  weekly 98% soft line + delete-ghost HIGH.** Merged upstream v0.9.1 +
  api-key login/profile delete (`3121836`; 6 conflicts — kept the fork's
  spare-based overview gap math + CAP-2/3 identity grafted into
  upstream's refactored `cmd_login`/`run_oauth_browser` shape, `--new`
  rides upstream's `LoginArgs`; union-merged completions/README/help).
  Adversarial 4-agent review of the merge confirmed a real HIGH:
  upstream's new `clauth delete` × the daemon's queued switch target —
  the ghost drain tore down the live credentials link BEFORE the
  too-late existence check and the retry nulled the ACTIVE profile's
  stored credentials. Fixed with two guards (`switch_profile` validates
  existence first — every caller; drain drops vanished targets, logged)
  in `5707fe4`, ported to PR #35. **AX's stuck-RateLimited complaint
  root-caused**: the 429 back-off ladder (calibrated 2026-07-11 against
  the since-fixed double-poll pathology) parked the ACTIVE profile in a
  15-min blind slot while the endpoint had already recovered (probe:
  ax-cl 200 while daemon waited; the account's limiter is dominated by
  the running claude's own traffic, so clauth's poll neither pins nor
  drains it). Fix `841e2bd`: active profile's ladder caps at 2× cadence
  (~3 min), idle keeps the full drain ladder, real retry-after still
  wins. **AX feature ask shipped** (`4ba6b38`): weekly (7d) window now
  gates at a 98% SOFT line instead of the 100% hard cap, applied to both
  walk directions (either-window switch trigger + candidate rejection +
  recovery + resume captions) — `WEEKLY_EXHAUST_PCT` in fallback.rs, a
  const by design (protects the chain, not per-member taste). Verified
  live: ax-cl hit 7d 98.0% minutes after deploy and is correctly
  weekly-excluded from the walk. Also closed the ledger's runtime
  fake-PID flake follow-up (`6db2733`, fail-alive poll windows 2s→10s).
  Upstream: fork main pushed (`a7d4ba4`), PR #34 rebased onto v0.9.1
  (725 green), PR #35 rebased clean + ghost-guard + flake commits (757
  green, comment posted explaining the delete interaction). Deployed:
  binary installed, daemon restarted (all three accounts Fresh
  post-deploy), TUI relaunched. Follow-up candidates for upstream after
  live soak: the active ladder cap + the weekly soft line (both change
  shared scheduler/fallback semantics uwuclxdy may want to weigh in on).

- **2026-07-12 (late evening) — weekly line configurable + free-typed
  thresholds (AX ask).** clauth: `WEEKLY_EXHAUST_PCT` const →
  `AppState.weekly_switch_threshold` (additive in profiles.toml, None →
  98 default, out-of-band values clamp back via
  `weekly_switch_threshold_pct()`), threaded through every fallback
  predicate + `ChainSnapshot.weekly_pct` + `scan_recovery`; new
  `set_weekly_threshold` socket op (validated 50..=100 on socket AND
  write-side op, TECH-7 persist) + `ConfigOp::SetWeeklyThreshold`;
  status.json publishes `weekly_switch_threshold`; TUI Config tab gains
  a "weekly limit" row (presets 90/95/98/100 + ⏎ custom editor 50–100,
  mirrors the refresh-row grammar). 865 tests, clippy clean
  (`03d231f`). ccsbar: decodes the field (98 fallback for old daemons),
  **ForecastEngine mirror now reads the line from status.json instead
  of hard-coding the retired 100 cap**; Configure disclosure gains the
  chain-wide "Weekly limit" row (presets + Custom…); per-account 5h
  threshold gets Custom… free-typed input on BOTH surfaces (capsule
  menu swaps to an inline field; context-menu Custom… opens the
  disclosure with the field armed); parsers mirror socket validation
  exactly (5h whole 0–100, weekly 50–100 decimals). 177 tests
  (`fccf472`). Deployed both; socket smoke test ok
  (`{"ok":true}` → `weekly_switch_threshold = 98.0` in profiles.toml).

- **2026-07-12 (night) — contribute-back: upstream PRs #36/#37/#38
  opened (AX ask).** Ports of this session's three shipped changes onto
  `upstream/mommy` (which has fallback.rs + scheduler.rs but NO daemon
  module), each branch independently green (727/729/729 tests + clippy)
  and pushed to origin. **#36** `pr/switch-vanished-guard` — the
  delete-ghost HIGH's actions.rs half only (existence-first guard in
  `switch_profile` + RED/GREEN test); daemon drain half dropped; the
  hazard is live upstream today (their v0.9.1 delete × async switch
  gate), so this outranks #35's copy — when #36 merges, #35's actions.rs
  hunk rebases away. **#37** `pr/active-backoff-cap` — 841e2bd port;
  applied clean because upstream already carries the rotation-coherence
  is_active plumbing; fork-only R3 stand-down tests spliced out of the
  test conflict. **#38** `pr/weekly-soft-line` — 4ba6b38 + 03d231f as
  two commits; dropped daemon socket/status_json/tick/types +
  fallback_config.rs (upstream persists via direct `save_app_state`, so
  step/commit handlers rewritten to that idiom — validation preserved:
  presets always in-band, `parse_weekly_pct` guards the editor, accessor
  clamps hand-edits); update_banner conflict resolved keeping ONLY the
  weekly_pct threading (fork's auth_broken banner d8ad828 does NOT ride
  along); README bullets re-merged upstream-side (no daemon/socket
  mentions). #37+#38 both touch scheduler.rs — disjoint hunks, noted in
  the PR body. Closes the "follow-up candidates after live soak" note
  above. Upstream had 1 new commit since SYNC-2 (9a982d4, TUI
  api-account rows — unrelated, no re-sync needed).
- **2026-07-12 (night) — upstream merged #34–38; corrections absorbed back
  into fork main (merge `66c109c`, AX ask).** uwuclxdy squash-merged all five
  contributed PRs but pushed fixes ON TOP of each before merging; the fork
  carried the pre-correction versions, so every fix was a real live bug on the
  fork. Strategy: `git merge upstream/mommy` (fork is 148 commits ahead — rebase
  was never an option), resolve every file to `--ours`, then port uwuclxdy's
  deltas surgically (isolated via `git diff pr/<branch>..<squash>` in a 6-agent
  read-only workflow). Ported: **#34** `adopt_disk_rotation` + `&RotationGuard`
  witness in oauth.rs (cross-process peer rotation was refreshing a spent token →
  false quarantine); **#36** shared `ensure_profile_exists` guarding ALL THREE
  switch primitives (fork guarded only `switch_profile`; `switch_profile_discard`
  / `_reconciled` tore down the live link on a ghost target); **#37**
  `ACTIVE_CAP_MAX_STREAK=6` releases the active 429 cap past a shallow streak (the
  #30 window-pinning failure); **#38** wrap-off `Off` keys on `WEEKLY_HARD_BLOCK_PCT`
  (100%) not the soft line + profile.rs wording clamp→reset + `WEEKLY_PRESETS`
  dedup; **#35(a)** status_json third-party freshness (api-key profiles derived
  `never-fetched` — a real ccsbar/ccu contract bug) + **#35(e)** reserved-name
  guard in `validate_profile_name` (rejects the 11 bare subcommand tokens incl.
  hidden `__complete`/`mcp-await-job`; NOT `completions`) + DESIGN.md `Z`→`+00:00`.
  +11 ported tests. **Skipped**: upstream's api-account re-login TUI rows (9a982d4
  — fork re-logins via inline BaseUrl/ApiKey rows; porting breaks 5 fork tests)
  and the overview orange-sweep pulse (070375f — cosmetic). **Dropped** upstream's
  `wiki/daemon.md` (fork canonical = `docs/ccsbar/DESIGN.md`). GOTCHA logged:
  `git checkout --ours` is a NO-OP on auto-merged (non-conflicted) files — the
  four skipped-feature files (config/format/header.rs, tui_render_mod.rs) silently
  kept upstream's code until re-reverted with `git checkout main -- <file>` (one
  test caught it). Verify: 876 tests + fmt + clippy clean; 6-agent adversarial
  port-coherence review returned 5 CONFIRMED_CORRECT + 1 low CONCERN (the two
  hidden reserved subcommands), fixed before commit. Fork daemon/fallback_config/
  doctor/logline/profile_json modules kept as-is (upstream now also has a daemon
  module from #35, but the fork's is the production version, ahead).
- **2026-07-12 (night) — adopted the two skipped upstream TUI features after
  all (AX: "upstream 更好就跟 upstream，以后 update 简单些；TUI 外观我没
  preference，基本走 ccsbar").** Reversed the initial skip once AX set the
  policy — the real win is DIVERGENCE REDUCTION, not looks: cherry-pick (`-x`,
  upstream authorship preserved) **B** `2eacd44` (070375f overview orange-sweep
  pulse — format.rs/header.rs now 0-diff vs upstream; overview.rs conflict
  resolved keeping the fork-only email column AFTER the pulse cell) and **A**
  `d455131` (9a982d4 api-account re-login/log-out rows — only app.rs's
  actions-import list conflicted, `CaptureIdentity` + `clear_profile_api_key`
  both kept; config_rows ungated so api accounts show Login+DeleteCreds; the 5
  visibility assertions in tui_app.rs auto-inverted to "api SHOWS login/delete"
  and pass; `clear_profile_api_key` = real api log-out that also purges
  THIRD_PARTY_CACHE_FILE, a genuine fork gap). 879 tests + fmt + clippy clean.
  Net: the fork's overview/format/header/config TUI surfaces now track upstream,
  so future syncs of those files stop conflicting.
- **2026-07-12 (night) — RLS-1: RateLimited staleness (uwuclxdy's #37 "principled
  follow-up", opted into).** The consumer-side complement to #37's poll-side cap:
  #37 keeps the active's 429 retries frequent so the `/usage` throttle window
  drains; RLS-1 handles the case where it stays stuck anyway. **Root wedge**:
  `scan_auto_switch` gated on `decision_fresh(active)` — only a `Fresh` active read
  is trusted to decide — so a stuck-RateLimited active (never `Fresh`) returned
  early every tick and the daemon wedged on it, exactly the AUTH-4 auth-broken
  wedge one class over. **Fix, 2 surgical parts mirroring AUTH-4**: (1) DECISION —
  a new `is_stuck_rate_limited(status, streak)` predicate (`RateLimited && streak >
  ACTIVE_CAP_MAX_STREAK`, reusing #37's own cap boundary as the deep-slot line);
  `scan_auto_switch` adds it as a 3rd bypass beside `active_broken`, so the walk
  RUNS — but unlike auth-broken it still faces `next_auto_switch_target`'s
  last-known exhaustion gate (guarded by `five_hour_live` + weekly reset), so a
  genuinely-spent stuck active rotates away (wedge fixed) while a throttle artifact
  with real headroom STAYS (no false switch). `fallback.rs` deliberately untouched
  — Gate 2 IS the safety. (2) CONTRACT — additive per-profile `stale: bool` in
  `status.json` (same shared predicate → decision & display can't drift, per the
  publish-don't-mirror rule); schema stays 1; single-shot `status --json` always
  false (no streak store). Threaded via `LiveSignals.streaks` (daemon snapshots
  `rate_limit_streaks` before the config lock, like the sibling stores). **TUI
  deliberately skipped** (AX: ccsbar-first, no TUI preference) — uwuclxdy's TUI cue
  is dead weight here; the decision fix delivers the anti-wedge win with zero
  client change. **Review**: 4-dimension × adversarial-refuter workflow
  (wf_caa4aad9-6a8) → 0 implementation defects (both verifiers confirmed the code
  correct), 2 CONFIRMED medium TEST-gaps fixed before commit — the scheduler test's
  "stay put" case used a LIVE low-util window (passed trivially, never exercised
  the `five_hour_live` guard) so a **lapsed-stale-HIGH** case was added (the real
  post-storm shape: `apply_outcome` freezes the last Fresh window at 100%, it
  lapses after ~5h → regained headroom → STAY; this is the exact RLS-1↔AUTH-4
  asymmetry, a broken active WALKS on the same store), and the `stale` status test
  was single-profile (couldn't catch compute-once-apply-to-all) so it now proves
  per-profile keying with work=stuck-RL(stale)+home=Fresh(not) in one body; 1
  finding REFUTED (no ccsbar wire collision — ccsbar's `isStale` is a client-side
  computed prop, not a decoded key, so the new field is cleanly additive). Verify:
  881 tests (+2, 4-case & 3-assert) + fmt + clippy clean. **ccsbar/ccu follow-up
  (deferred, additive)**: consume `stale` to dim a distrusted reading, preferring
  the daemon flag over ccsbar's existing client-side `isStale` derivation.

## 2026-07-15 — upstream 0.11.0 merge + RESCUE-1 (dead-live-login reclaim)

**Incident (2026-07-14→15)**: live `.credentials.json` diverged ("matches no
stored account"), daemon rotated stored ax-backup 3×8h without write-back, live
refresh lineage died → every Claude session "Login expired"; all switches
deferred ("unsaved credentials — resolve in the TUI") → ccsbar "switch didn't
take". Root cause chain: 0.9.1's outdated wire shape made the `/profile`
identity probe fail; `fetch_account_identity` collapses probe failure into
"identity unproven"; `follow_live_login` memoized that verdict against the
login (follow_memo) → one bad probe = permanent wedge, TUI-only escape.

**Fix 1 — merge upstream/mommy v0.11.0+12 (66→0885756)**: wire-parity
(AuthClient::Profile, CC-shaped refresh/login), quarantine only on
endpoint-confirmed dead (48ba4b7), sibling identity by account uuid (daa4c98),
single-fetcher FetchLease (adopted, replaces fork never-probe), PollStreaks
{rate_limit, refresh_fail} (adopted; RLS-1 deduped to upstream's is_stuck_streak).
Kept fork: VecDeque pending-switch queue, feed superset (forecast/last_error/
last_switch/account_email), CaptureIdentity model (upstream's account_uuid
commit-seeding reconciled INTO it; TUI relogin now anchors from the mint's own
probe — Known — instead of Unknown), burn_rate_for_profile pub(crate),
docs/ccsbar/DESIGN.md as contract home (wiki/ stays deleted; lease/auth_status/
next_refresh_at-null notes ported). Upstream's strict per-profile key-set test
adopted + account_email added. 1044 tests, fmt, clippy clean.

**Fix 2 — RESCUE-1 (tick.rs)**: `LiveOwner::Unknown` now carries a reason
(ForeignAccount | AccessDead | Unproven). Only a PROVEN-foreign login memoizes;
probe failures retry on a 30-min timer (follow_retry_at) — memo-poison fixed.
AccessDead → `rescue_dead_live_login`: refresh-probe the live refresh token —
`invalid_grant` → reclaim (AUTH-1 install gate + fingerprint race guard +
force_link back to the active's stored chain); refresh SUCCESS → the pair was
alive, write it back in place (`claude::write_live_oauth_pair`, surgical JSON
update preserving mcpOAuth etc.) and re-identify; transient → timed retry.
New: usage::IdentityProbe{Proven/Rejected/Indeterminate} (401→Rejected,
403 stays Indeterminate — WAF caution mirrors refresh_rejection_is_terminal).
6 new tests (reclaim / transient-backoff / alive-write-back / broken-stored-
refuse / refreshless-reclaim / mid-probe race abort).

**RESCUE-1b addendum (same night)**: live deploy revealed the actual wedged
state was CC's logged-out SHELL (accessToken/refreshToken both "", expiresAt 0
— CC blanks the file when its refresh dies, keeping mcpOAuth). A shell has no
fingerprint → follow bailed before the rescue engaged. Added
claude::live_login_is_empty + shell branch reclaiming through the shared
reclaim_live_slot (extracted from the dead-login tail; AUTH-1 gate + late
still-unchanged re-check + timer on failure legs). 4 tests.

**Adversarial review (12 agents)**: merge-semantics 0 findings, security 0.
Rescue-correctness 2 CONFIRMED + fixed (write-back leg missing fingerprint
guard → clobber risk on concurrent CC login; write-back zeroed follow_retry_at
→ per-tick refresh storm on a still-401ing-yet-refreshable token — now arms
the 30-min window; the user is already unblocked by the write-back itself).
Test-fidelity 5 gaps closed (identity classification extracted pure +
truth-table pinned: 401-only Rejected; probe-outage no-memo; reclaim-failure
and write-back-failure arms via chmod-locked sandbox dirs; gate-Transient;
blank-uuid; foreign-during-backoff). 1 refuted. Final: 1056 tests, clippy 0.

**Deployed 2026-07-15 23:10 PDT**: clauth 0.11.0, daemon respawned, RESCUE-1b
fired ONE TICK after boot: "live login for 'ax-backup' is a logged-out shell
(no tokens left) — reclaimed the live slot". .credentials.json → symlink to
healthy stored chain; doctor 7/7; last_error null; live expiry +7h. The
2026-07-14 outage class (probe failure → divergence memo-poison → dual-lineage
race → dead live login → wedged switches) is closed end-to-end: wire parity
prevents the misclassification, timed retries replace the memo-poison, and
the rescue reclaims both corpse variants (endpoint-confirmed-dead, shell).

## 2026-07-16 — RESCUE-2: full-audit fixes (switch unwedge + follow/rescue hardening) + CDX-0b re-eval

**Trigger**: user asked "还有什么问题你仔细fully review audit一遍". 27-agent audit
workflow (6 dimensions + adversarial verify per finding): 15 confirmed / 6
refuted of 21 raw. Production timeline corroborated the top finding: 07-14
21:02 "matches no stored account" (a genuine 4th account in the live slot) →
33h wedge — 4× 8h rotations refused, user switches 04:41-04:50 "gave up" —
healed only when the foreign login died into a shell (RESCUE-1b reclaim
06:10:16). Refuted class worth remembering: rotating the STORED chain while
foreign-diverged does NOT kill the foreign live login (separate chains;
Keychain write already guarded by live_login_is_foreign) — the overnight death
was CC-side, not ours.

**RESCUE-2 (HIGH F1, tick.rs drain_pending_switch + claude.rs)**: a queued
Origin::User switch no longer wedges behind a diverged live login — the
socket path (ccsbar tap) had no DivergenceChoice and fail_switch'd forever.
Now: archive the unsaved login to `~/.clauth/quarantine/<ms>-<seq>-<name>.
credentials.json` (0600, newest-20 retention, seq breaks same-ms collisions)
then `switch_profile_discard`. Divergence re-verified INSIDE the state flock;
archive failure fails the switch (login untouched). Scheduler-origin still
defers — automation may not discard a login clauth doesn't own; a user tap IS
the operator decision the old TUI-only escape waited for.

**RESCUE-2b (F2/F3/F5/F8/F11)**: (a) ForeignAccount verdict now requires
COMPLETE anchor coverage over login-holding profiles — incomplete → Unproven
+ 30-min timer + once-per-window log (a legit profile can lack an anchor:
dropped on unproven re-login, backfilled by the hourly /profile poll; memo
would wedge an owned login). (b) blank-access+present-refresh live file (torn
write): reclaim iff the refresh byte-matches the active's stored chain, else
timer-gated visible no-op — was a silent per-tick nothing. (c) sibling
capture/overwrite failures arm the timer instead of memoizing (memo is
proven-foreign ONLY now — the stated RESCUE-1 invariant, enforced); adoption
attempt itself timer-gated. (d) follow_memo/follow_retry_at persist across
restarts (`~/.clauth/daemon-follow.json`, saved on change by the
follow_live_login_with wrapper) — a launchd respawn inside the 30-min window
no longer re-probes/re-spends per boot (restarts ARE a real event class:
2× within 8 min on 07-16).

**RESCUE-2c (F4/F6/F7)**: write_live_oauth_pair takes the expected fingerprint
and re-checks it INSIDE the flock, returning LiveWriteBack::{Written,
Superseded} — the symlink case is now benign Superseded (was a scary "its
chain is lost; re-login" Err for a race that loses nothing);
force_link_profile_credentials_if re-checks still_unchanged under the flock
(reclaim's check→mutate window closed to clauth actors; CC-side residual is
inherent). proactive_rotation_due gains an active_diverged input — never
preemptively rotate a diverged active's stored chain (mirrors
rotation_candidates' skip_active).

**Tests**: +13 (drain user-archive/scheduler-defer, anchor-gap no-memo,
overwrite-failure timer, degraded-copy reclaim, unrecognized-refresh timer,
restart persistence ×2, Refreshed-gate reclaim, truth-table Parse +
blank-email, write-back supersede ×2 + surgical-write, quarantine retention).
1069 pass, clippy 0, fmt clean. Docs: DESIGN.md status.json example gained
the 8 shipped-but-undocumented fields (clauth_version/last_switch/last_error/
weekly_switch_threshold/burn_aware/forecast/fallback_chain/fallback.
last_resort) + set_last_resort/set_weekly_threshold socket commands + version
literals bumped. Note: "docs/wire-parity.md" never existed — wire-parity
lives in code + fetch truth-table tests; don't reference it as a file.

**Post-fix adversarial re-review (opus)**: verdict SHIP, 0 CRIT/HIGH; 5 LOW
all addressed (lock poison test sandbox-pinned — parallel flake; quarantine
retention; anchor-gap log; two documented trade-offs: Superseded deliberately
doesn't arm the timer, tier-1 adoption waits out an unrelated armed window).

**CDX-0b (docs/codex-support/feasibility.md §0b)**: 4-track re-eval overturns
the 07-12 "in-session hot-swap structurally impossible" headline — true for
auth.json swap (now doubly guarded at HEAD cbc83d9), REFUTED for a localhost
header-rewriting proxy (Authorization + ChatGPT-Account-ID; proven by
ndycode/codex-multi-auth 391★ et al; rate-limit telemetry rides through free).
Revised ladder: CDX-1 session-boundary swap → CDX-1b per-CODEX_HOME → CDX-1c
swap+resume wrapper → CDX-2 passive JSONL usage → CDX-5 injection proxy
(opt-in seamless tier). Still DEFERRED — no build decision made.

## 2026-07-16 (later) — CDX-1/1c/2 SHIPPED: codex account switching (session-boundary MVP + passive usage)

AX un-deferred the CDX milestone ("那我们继续搞codex"). Upstream issue #45:
uwuclxdy says out-of-scope for him (no codex subscription), not against it,
asks for a rough system design in the issue — posted after this ship (with
LLM disclosure, per his request). Fork-side feature.

**Plan**: docs/codex-support/PLAN.md (reviewed via plan-design pass: 2 HIGH
promoted to tasks T1b + MCP-in-T6 before build). Design pillars: TWO
independent active slots (`active_profile` claude / `active_codex_profile` —
switching one never touches the other); explicit persisted `harness` field
(serde default claude, zero migration, byte-stable render); whole-file raw
byte round-trip store `profiles/<name>/codex-auth.json` (unmodeled fields
survive; identity/plan/email parsed locally from stored JWTs — zero network);
no symlink/Keychain — content compare by `tokens.account_id` anchor +
one-directional adopt-back (daemon NEVER writes live outside a switch);
loss-free switch (rotated outgoing chain adopted back first; foreign login
archived to quarantine `.codex-auth.json` suffix or refused per
ForeignLivePolicy — User origins archive, Scheduler defers, RESCUE-2
semantics); keyring/auto/ephemeral store modes refused; per-harness chains
(codex_fallback_chain stored, walk lands with CDX-4).

**Shipped surfaces**: `clauth login <name> --codex` (capture; CAP-3 dedup;
reauth-in-place), `clauth <name>` harness-dispatched switch (CLI [y/N]
archive prompt for foreign; pgrep session-boundary note), `clauth resume
<name>` (CDX-1c: switch + `codex resume --last` — semi-seamless carryover;
"resume" now reserved), socket/daemon drain codex arm, MCP switch dispatch +
list_profiles harness field, TUI (Codex tag, openai provider, plan/email
from lens, per-slot active dot, Enter→codex switch, Setup rows drop ALL
claude-shaped dead ends, log-out via codex_clear_profile_auth), doctor
check_codex (silent claude-only, WARN-only, >7d snapshot staleness),
status.json additive: per-profile harness + per-slot active +
codex_snapshot_at + top-level active_codex_profile (DESIGN.md synced).
CDX-2: passive usage — src/codex/usage.rs ports ccu's session-JSONL reader
(mtime-ordered capped walk, tail reads, resumed-session-in-old-dir catch,
.zst recognized-skipped, NO zstd dep — 0/1136 local files compressed);
scheduler lease-holder tick gains codex_passive_tick publishing through the
exact fetch-outcome channels (cache/store/status/cadence) for the ACTIVE
codex profile; attribution gate = event ts >= live auth.json mtime (every
account change rewrites it) — conservative staleness over misattribution.

**Invariants encoded as tests**: codex profiles NEVER enter either Anthropic
fetch leg (explicit guards + adversarial regression test); harness
immutability BOTH directions (capture refuses claude targets; cmd_login +
overwrite_captured_profile + edit_profile_endpoint refuse codex targets —
the last found by a post-fix re-verify agent: TUI BaseUrl row was reachable);
switching TO the live owner never rolls a fresher chain back; wholesale
`config.state = update_app_state(...)` sync (claude-follow parity — partial
copy-back dropped same-tick external edits).

**Review**: 13-agent workflow (4 dimensions × adversarial verify): 8
confirmed (1 HIGH login-corruption, 2 MED MCP/status-test, rest LOW/NIT) all
fixed, 1 refuted; HIGH fix re-verified by a dedicated agent (found the
edit_profile_endpoint gap, fixed + tested). Final cross-phase pass on the
CDX-2/1c diff. ~72 new tests; suite 1069 → 1141, clippy 0.

**Deferred**: CDX-1b isolated CODEX_HOME start (needs session refcounting —
two-carrier refresh_token_reused hazard; revisit with CDX-3 refresh
ownership); CDX-3 refresh/PKCE login; CDX-4 codex chain walk; CDX-5 proxy
(own design round — nothing in CDX-1/2 constrains it). tokens.json codex
feed = follow-up with ccu migration (ccu keeps direct JSONL reads for now).

**AX manual acceptance (never run unattended)**: `clauth login <name>
--codex` against the real live login, a real two-account codex switch, and
`clauth resume`. Daemon deploy = cargo install + pkill (authorized).

## CDX wave 2 — CDX-3 / CDX-1b / CDX-4 / CDX-5 (2026-07-16, second wave)

The deferred ladder, shipped end to end. Commits caf2f01 (CDX-3) · e2d0fd2
(CDX-1b) · 47eb421 (CDX-4) · <this> (CDX-5). Wire facts re-verified at
openai/codex `9ff47868` / codex-cli 0.144.5.

- **CDX-3 standby refresh + PKCE login**: `src/codex/oauth.rs` (JSON refresh
  wire, all-optional response only-if-present overwrite, failure taxonomy
  mirroring codex's classifier, surgical apply_refresh raw round-trip,
  standby_due). Scheduler `codex_standby_tick` refreshes ONLY chains clauth
  exclusively holds (never the live owner, never a leased/broken profile) —
  `codex_standby_candidates` + RotationGuard across the spend + in-guard
  re-check + discard-if-chain-moved. `RotationProbe` (non-blocking, rank-
  exempt) guards switch/capture against a mid-flight refresh. `src/loopback.rs`
  extracted from oauth_login (claude tests pin it byte-identical); `src/codex/
  login.rs` = codex browser PKCE (fixed ports 1455/1457, form-encoded
  exchange, optional API-key mint, explicit auth_mode). `clauth login <name>
  --codex --browser` → store-only (live untouched). doctor: quarantine +
  stale-keep-alive WARNs.
- **CDX-1b isolated start**: `CodexRuntime` (codex-sessions/ lease flocks,
  live-owner + store-mode + loginless refusals, config.toml COPIED not
  symlinked, 60s adopt-back watchdog + final sync, gc rescue). `clauth start
  <codex-profile>` spawns codex in its own CODEX_HOME. Two-carrier refusals
  wired into switch/capture/standby.
- **CDX-4 codex chain**: `snapshot_codex_chain` + `next_codex_auto_switch_
  target` (claude walk shapes minus decision_fresh/kick/Off; exhaustion =
  percent shape OR codex's own rate_limit_reached_type verdict). `UsageInfo`
  carries `codex_rate_limit_reached` (single source cache→store→status).
  Per-harness pending-switch queue independence (PendingSwitchEntry.harness;
  drain services one winner per harness). Chain edits route by harness;
  `clauth fallback` CLI; status.json `codex_fallback_chain` + per-harness
  fallback blocks.
- **CDX-5 injection proxy** (`src/proxy/`): `clauth proxy` — opt-in localhost
  SSE proxy. Strips codex identity headers, injects the selected pool
  account's, forwards to chatgpt.com/backend-api/codex, streams SSE back; a
  pre-commit 429/401/5xx rotates to the next chain account and replays before
  the client sees a byte. Pool = codex chain (sticky-active, per-account
  cooldown ≥60s). Token freshness: live-owner reads live, parked chains
  refresh via CDX-3 (single-writer flock shared with the daemon). Usage from
  the flow-through x-codex-* headers → per-account cache; heartbeat file makes
  the passive JSONL leg stand down while the proxy serves (no misattribution).
  `clauth proxy --print-config` prints the config.toml block (never edited).
  doctor: proxy heartbeat + config-pointed check. Stub-upstream e2e proves
  injection + rotate-replay + SSE relay + usage capture.

Suite 1141 → ~1225 (clippy 0, fmt clean). Plan-review round (5-dim
adversarial workflow + refute) folded in before build: per-harness queue
gates, UsageInfo carrier, config.toml copy, proxy compression/framing/caps,
passive-leg heartbeat, doc reconciliations. Design posted to uwuclxdy/clauth#45
remains the wave-1 doc; wave-2 detail in docs/codex-support/{PLAN,proxy-design}.md.

**AX manual acceptance (never run unattended)**: real `clauth login <name>
--codex --browser`, a real codex chain switch, real `clauth proxy` against the
live backend (config paste + real 429 rotation). ToS posture unchanged
(passive + flow-through only; wham/usage never called).

## 2026-07-16 (later) — sandboxed switch verification + narrow-TUI (phone) mode

- **codex-sim harness** (`scripts/codex-sim/`, commit 5b570f1): the PLAN.md
  CDX-1 "sandboxed end-to-end" acceptance is now a script. Second daemon under
  an isolated `$HOME`, two fake accounts (unsigned JWTs; fresh `last_refresh`
  + far-future `exp` so CDX-3 standby never fires network), user switch swaps
  live bytes verbatim, forged weekly-only rate-limited JSONL drives a REAL
  auto-switch (verdict remapped to the weekly slot), real `~/.codex`
  hash-verified untouched. 8/8 PASS. Residual (needs a real 2nd paid account,
  AX-manual): OpenAI accepting the swapped token, real 429 JSONL shape,
  server-side refresh-reuse. NOTE for advice-giving: a switch never disturbs
  RUNNING codex processes (auth cached in memory) — only new sessions pick up
  the new account, so live-testing with a free account doesn't stop in-flight
  work.
- **Narrow-TUI (phone ≈45 col) adaptation** (commit f10fe99): single
  breakpoint `panes::NARROW_BODY_W = 60`; master-detail stacks (shared
  `panes::master_detail`, 6 call sites incl. tokens Models), tokens dashboard
  stacks all cards, chain-row gauge sized from leftover width (exact span
  budget), footer measured degradation (essentials always survive), header
  dangling-`·` fix, status duration drops to its own line, modals pre-split
  over-wide lines by char (`chunk_line` — exact height by construction).
  Desktop byte-identical ≥60 (pinned by tests). Suite 1228 green.
  **Upstreamed**: issue uwuclxdy/clauth#48 + PR #49 (branch `feat/narrow-tui`
  off `mommy`, 970 upstream tests green). Review pass: MED gauge budget
  off-by-one (fixed, 3-digit threshold test added), LOW modal word-wrap
  height (fixed via chunk_line), NITs fixed.
- Upstream is now 12 ahead of the fork's merge-base (v0.12.0: owner-only
  perms fix 7f2d4db, durable token ledger c8de3fe) — candidates for the next
  upstream-sync pass.

## 2026-07-16 (later) — CDX-5 real-backend proof · GET /models fix · 0.12.0 sync + history squash · upstream codex PR

- **CDX-5 proxy PROVEN against the LIVE backend** (feasibility.md §"Real-backend
  confirmed"; deploy-shape memory updated). Shipped `clauth proxy` binary built
  on an isolated throwaway host, run under an isolated `$HOME` (pool = a real
  paid `ax-codex-cl` Plus profile, `codex-auth.json` scp'd in + deleted after),
  isolated-`CODEX_HOME` real `codex exec` → real `chatgpt.com/backend-api/codex`
  → real model answer (`PROXY_OK 42`, 15,856 tokens). **OpenAI honors the
  proxy-injected `Authorization`+`ChatGPT-Account-ID`.** The host's own live
  codex session (different account) untouched (sha256 identical). Probe kept:
  `scripts/codex-sim/proxy-client-integration.sh` (client-integration half; commit
  0fd4e20). Still not exercised: a real forced-429 rotation (unit-proven only).
- **GET /models fix** (commit 906ff8e): the real run showed the proxy 405'd
  codex's `GET /backend-api/codex/models` refresh (POST-only gate). Now admits
  GET too and forwards with the request's own method (generic ureq header helper
  serves both body typestates). Tests: GET /models forwarded + method preserved
  + identity injected; DELETE still 405s.
- **Synced fork to upstream 0.12.0** (merge 4f930e0 → then squashed): 19-file
  conflict merge (ratatui refactors + owner-only perms vs fork TUI/profile),
  resolved via a parallel resolver workflow + hand-resolution of scheduler.rs
  (kept upstream's scan_recovery tests, adapted to the fork's VecDeque
  PendingSwitchEntry API) + a tokens::spawn arity fix (0.12.0 added the
  durable-ledger `clauth_dir` arg). Suite **1254 green**, clippy/fmt clean.
- **History squash** (force-pushed 57917d9): collapsed ~192 fork commits into
  **8 subsystem commits** on 0.12.0 (codex+proxy / usage-scheduler / daemon /
  tui / tests / docs / core / meta) so future upstream rebases replay 8, not
  192. Tree byte-identical to the verified merge (`git diff` empty — safety
  gate). NOT feature-pure (shared files interleave codex/narrow-tui/keychain —
  can't file-split); coherent-by-subsystem was AX's chosen granularity.
- **Upstream codex PR**: uwuclxdy/clauth **#51** (`xingfanxia:main` → `mommy`),
  the complete compilable+tested fork codex support on 0.12.0. Supersedes #49
  (narrow-tui overlaps in the render files). Upstream has no codex sub → can't
  test codex; claude-side is byte-identical.

## 2026-07-17 — post-0.12.0 upstream catch-up (merge 2497a36)

- **Why PRs went CONFLICTING**: uwuclxdy pushed 4 commits to `mommy` AFTER our
  0.12.0 sync — reload fingerprinting (c4faec0: config.toml edits hot-reload
  without restart), bounded state-lock acquisition (26b1e3e), auto-start window
  kick fix (1470147), wiki note (63d8f21). Merged them in (5 conflicts:
  tick.rs ×7 hunks, mod.rs, daemon_mod/profile tests, wiki modify/delete).
- **Fingerprint conversion**: every fork-only `last_state_mtime` site (codex
  follow/switch, claude follow, drain_config_ops, 2 TUI sites upstream never
  touched — auto-merged but referencing the dead field) converted to
  `last_reload_fp`/`reload_fingerprint()`. `drain_config_ops` keeps the fork's
  pinned contract: config.toml-only edit (Ok(false)) does NOT adopt — one
  harmless self-reload next tick beats swallowing a same-tick external edit.
- **wiki/daemon.md restored** to upstream's copy — the fork had deleted `wiki/`
  long ago, so every upstream wiki edit re-conflicted with our deletion; keeping
  the file kills that conflict class permanently and cleans the PR diff.
- Suite **1262 green** (+8 upstream tests), clippy/fmt clean. PR #51 back to
  MERGEABLE; #49 got a supersession comment (offer to rebuild standalone if
  uwuclxdy wants narrow-tui alone). Local daemon reinstalled + respawned.

## 2026-07-17 (later) — CDX-5 proxy deployed on AX's Mac (AX-approved)

- **Trigger**: ccsbar switch to ax-codex-cl looked "broken" — running codex had
  the old (limit-hit) auth cached in memory; on-disk switch was fine. Diagnosis
  chain: JWT-claim compare (live == cl profile), fresh `codex exec` turn OK.
- **Deploy shape**: LaunchAgent `com.clauth.proxy` (KeepAlive-on-crash, port
  4517, `~/.clauth/proxy.log`) + global `model_provider = "clauth"` in
  `~/.codex/config.toml`; `codex --profile direct` = bypass; pre-change backup
  kept. Live-verified: PROXY_OK (profile), GLOBAL_PROXY_OK (default),
  DIRECT_OK (escape hatch).
- **Codex ≥0.144 gotcha**: `[profiles.x]` in config.toml is now a hard error —
  profiles moved to `~/.codex/<name>.config.toml` overlay files.
- **`codex exec` stdin gotcha**: blocks in `resolve_root_prompt` until stdin
  EOF — a backgrounded shell's held-open pipe hangs it forever; `< /dev/null`.

## 2026-07-18 — CLA-SPLIT: long-lived session tokens (commit 57cef39)

- **Why**: 2026-07-16..18 all three claude accounts serially died with
  `refresh token revoked` — N long-lived CC sessions + clauth's refresher all
  rotating single-use chains through the one live slot; a stale-token refresh
  trips reuse detection and revokes the whole chain. oat-only migration was
  ruled out live (setup-token scope = inference+sessions → usage endpoint 403s).
- **Design (split credentials per profile)**: `session-token.json` (static
  `claude setup-token` mint) is what switches install — sessions run on a
  never-rotating token; `credentials.json` OAuth becomes clauth-private,
  usage-only, single-writer. `install_source_path` is the one concept: classify
  /first-login/link/keychain/snapshot/adopt/`clauth start` runtime all resolve
  through it. Guards: snapshot & runtime watchdog never write the token over
  the usage pair; rotation persist never mirrors the usage chain over an
  installed token; gate is Ready for split profiles unless the token is
  clock-dead (Broken + re-mint hint). Non-split profiles byte-identical.
- **Review (opus code-reviewer)**: HIGH `clauth start` runtime still handed
  sessions credentials.json (fixed: canonical_credentials → install source +
  watchdog never adopts over the token); MED gate ignored token's own clock
  (fixed); LOW TUI relink affordance + keychain double-stat TOCTOU (fixed).
  force_snapshot left as-is: user-confirmed Overwrite writes the captured
  OAuth into credentials.json (usage side) and relink reinstalls the token —
  correct destination, no clobber.
- **herdr real-backend validation 7/7 PASS** (isolated $HOME, zylos sha256
  unchanged): switch links live→session-token.json; real turn `SPLIT_OK` on
  the clauth-installed token; **image turn `IMAGE_OK red`** (file_upload-scope
  concern cleared — images ride messages inline); usage pair byte-identical
  after real turns; live token unrotated.
- **Deployed**: three Mac profiles filled from `~/.claude-fleet/
  claude_long_live_tokens.env` (tokens verified ALIVE + sha256-matched to the
  fleet hosts' mints — first probe false-401'd by quoted-value parsing, fixed);
  binary installed, daemon restarted. Split arms per profile at its NEXT
  switch (live slot still holds the old OAuth until then). 1266 tests green.

## 2026-07-18 (later) — CLA-SPLIT upstreamed + docs

- Upstream contribution: issue **uwuclxdy/clauth#52** (root-cause writeup) +
  PR **#53** (`feat/session-token-split` cherry-picked onto CURRENT mommy,
  re-adapted to upstream's pre-CAP-1 snapshot/adopt idioms — no fork private
  refactors dragged along; 1111 tests green, clippy/fmt clean). Claude-side,
  so upstream can test it himself (unlike codex PR #51).
- Feature doc: `docs/claude-split/README.md` (problem, split table,
  semantics incl. per-profile arming + auth_broken="usage broken", ops
  runbook: fill shape, yearly re-mint ~2027-06-28, quoted-env gotcha).
- Mac state: all 3 profiles filled; ax-backup armed (live slot = its
  session token, verified symlink + no-refresh-token); ax-main/ax-cl arm at
  their next switch; all 3 usage legs Fresh after AX's re-logins.

## 2026-07-18 (PROX-1) — proxy stream-death incident: root-caused + fixed

- **Incident**: overnight codex sessions (xhigh, 20M+ ctx) died repeatedly
  with "stream disconnected before completion: stream closed before
  response.completed", reconnect-looping with no visible progress; proxy.log
  was 211/215 lines of unstamped "connection error" noise. NOT an OpenAI
  outage — three interlocking proxy defects:
  1. `PROXY_AGENT` `timeout_global(15min)` truncated ACTIVE streams (ureq's
     global timeout covers the body read and fires even while bytes flow) —
     real xhigh reasoning requests exceed 15 min; each kill made codex replay
     the turn from scratch (no server-side resume) → "半天看不到 update".
  2. Upstream holds the SSE stream open past `response.completed` (keepalives;
     codex closes first) → relay lingered per turn until dead-client write or
     backstop → spurious error per SUCCESSFUL turn + thread pile-up toward
     the 64-conn cap (over-cap = 503s).
  3. No timestamps, no per-request summaries → forensics near-impossible.
- **Fix** (src/proxy/sse.rs NEW + mod.rs relay rewrite + oauth.rs):
  `TerminalSniffer` — prefix-classifies SSE lines (terminal data line is one
  100s-of-KB line; classifying at its newline never matches — sniffer bug #1
  caught live), ARMS on `event:`/`data:` terminal forms, FIRES at the event's
  blank-line terminator (firing on the prefix truncated the completed event —
  sniffer bug #2, caught live within minutes). timeout_global 15min → 2h pure
  leak backstop. `enable_timestamps()` + one summary logline per request
  (account/method/path/status/bytes/secs/end-shape).
- **Method**: real wire captured via scratchpad TCP tee (codex → tee → proxy):
  `event: <name>` + `data: {"type":"<name>",...}` + blank line; terminal data
  line carries the whole response object on ONE line. Fixture gap that hid it:
  test SSE bodies had Content-Length + short lines.
- **Validated**: 1277 tests green (9 new sniffer units + lingering-upstream
  e2e asserting FULL-event relay + ureq active-stream-truncation semantics
  pin); live `codex exec` turn → log `POST /responses → 200 · 91KB in 1s ·
  completed`, clean close, no spurious errors. Proxy + daemon restarted on
  the new binary.

## 2026-07-18 (PROX-2) — the ACTUAL assassin was timeout_recv_response(30s)

- PROX-1's timestamped summaries immediately exposed the deeper truth: live
  turns died `TRUNCATED after …B in 29s · upstream error: timeout: receive
  response`. In ureq 3, `timeout_recv_response` keeps running through the
  BODY read (pinned: `ureq_recv_response_timeout_kills_the_streaming_body`)
  — the 30s value killed EVERY >30s stream all along; the 15min global was
  likely never the binding constraint. PROXY_AGENT now sets NO recv-response
  timeout (connect 10s + global 2h backstop only).
- Review findings folded in: sniffer also terminates on the Responses API
  top-level `error` stream event (`event: error` / `data: {"type":"error"`);
  residual format-drift 2h-linger documented as accepted tradeoff.
- Live-proved: 48s / 793KB single stream → `completed` clean close (old
  binary died at 29s).
- Config timeline: AX rolled `~/.codex/config.toml` back to
  `.bak-pre-proxy` (05:02, direct mode); the re-appended
  `[model_providers.clauth]` DEFINITION block was commented out at 05:11 —
  **by AX manually** (CORRECTION: first attributed to zylos on
  timing+file-header inference without verification; AX confirmed it was
  their own hand. No agent contests this file — zylos only manages its
  project trust entries per the header). `~/.codex/proxy.config.toml`
  overlay exists for opt-in routing (`codex --profile proxy`, sibling of
  direct.config.toml); the ccsbar PROXY-1 toggle edits config.toml freely.

## 2026-07-18 (SCW-1) — per-model weekly windows join the claude chain walk

- Trigger: Anthropic's "7d fable" per-model weekly window (~half the
  aggregate weekly). Live shape: ax-cl at 7d 65% / 5h 0% but fable 100% —
  the aggregate-only walk scored it healthiest and stranded fable sessions.
- Shipped (797bff8): two-tier walk, no new config. Tier 1 = clear on
  aggregate gates AND every live scoped window; tier 2 (old acceptance) only
  when no fully-clear member exists. Healthy-but-scoped-blocked active hops
  only to a fully-clear member (no ping-pong). find_recovered_member prefers
  fully-clear. Scoped windows NEVER count as full exhaustion — wrap-off Off /
  soonest_resume / recovery premise stay on the aggregate cap. 7 new tests.
- ccsbar PROXY-1 (98fe1e6): codex-page "Proxy mode" toggle — flips the
  top-level model_provider line in ~/.codex/config.toml (definition block
  always kept for session resume), bootstraps the proxy LaunchAgent, caption
  warns routed-but-not-serving; state re-read per panel open so any outside
  edit of the file is visible. Pure transforms unit-tested.

## 2026-07-18 (TSW-1) — timeout-semantics sweep (post-PROX-2 class hunt)

- Swept all 11 timeout/deadline sites in clauth + ccsbar + ccu against the
  pinned ureq-3 fact (recv_response counts through the body). Fixed
  (8083d5f): mcp serve() gc moved off the initialize path (BUG — 3s probe
  killed healthy servers while gc deleted multi-GB stale isolated trees);
  claude.rs link/force_link Keychain write now precedes the symlink swap
  (ordering BUG — failed ACL-prompt write stranded link=new/Keychain=old);
  loopback OAuth catcher 10s→60s (could drop the real callback + its
  single-use code); pricing 15s→60s, status feed 10s→30s (through-body
  semantics on multi-hundred-KB fetches); update.rs caution comment (dead
  FORK_BUILD code, exact incident shape if re-enabled). ccsbar (8285a47):
  truncated daemon reply now surfaces as connectedNoReply instead of
  misreading as unreachable → CLI double-apply. Verified SAFE: proxy client
  socket, daemon socket, doctor, lock chain 25s/20s/30s, oauth AGENT, ccu.

## 2026-07-18 (SCW-1 upstreamed) — issue #54 + PR #55

- `feat/scoped-weekly-walk` (36affbe) off current upstream/mommy (f524a8a).
  Adaptation: upstream's candidate walk already carries a FRESHNESS
  preference pass — composed as a 4-tier stack (scoped-clear+fresh →
  scoped-clear → fresh → any; scoped-clear outranks freshness: known
  model-block > stale-read uncertainty). Upstream ChainMember grew
  `max_spend` (spend-budget feature) — test initializers updated. proxy/
  sse.rs hunk dropped from the pick (fork-only). 1114 tests green, clippy
  clean. NOTE: upstream mommy moved again (3 TUI/docs commits post-2497a36)
  — PRs #51/#53 may need another conflict check.

## 2026-07-18 (SCW-2) — PR #55 reworked to per-account gates (maintainer review)

- uwuclxdy on PR #55: wants per-account Fallback-tab toggles, not a global
  preference — "weekly usage" / "scoped usage" checks switchable per member
  ("users may still want to use that account with other models or exclude
  only the maxxed out fable account from rotation"). Implemented on
  `feat/scoped-weekly-walk` (3d312a1, after merging mommy 6a793d5):
  `Profile::check_weekly` / `check_scoped` (default ON; config.toml keys,
  absent = on), ChainMember mirrors, TUI rows `weekly gate` / `scoped gate`
  (11-col labels; maintainer's wording lives in the state-flipping hints).
  SEMANTICS CHANGE vs SCW-1: scoped-blocked (gate on) is now a HARD
  rotation exclusion — the 4-tier preference stack collapsed back to
  2 passes (clear+fresh → clear) with a stronger accept; `check_weekly`
  off lifts the soft weekly line only (`weekly_line()` — the 100% hard cap
  always blocks); scoped still never counts as full exhaustion (wrap-off /
  soonest_resume / recovery premise stay aggregate-keyed); recovery still
  relinks a model-blocked member as last pick. New `BlockedReason::
  ScopedSpent` chip (◇, "7d fable 100% · other models ok"). 1152 tests
  green, clippy clean. Replied on #55: defaults + hard-cap floor flagged
  for veto; weekly-limit-per-account answered as "override with global
  default, follow-up PR" (rotate-at pattern).
- FORK NOTE: fork main still runs SCW-1 preference-stack semantics — the
  SCW-2 gate rework is upstream-branch only until AX wants it adopted.

## 2026-07-18 (CLA-SPLIT-2) — #53 follow-ups into the same PR + fork + ccsbar

- PR #53 follow-ups implemented on `feat/session-token-split` (2022c4e,
  after merging mommy) and cherry-picked to fork main (f55146f; conflicts:
  fork's --new/--codex login flags + account_email row composed with the
  new --setup-token/--yes + session row):
  * `clauth login <p> --setup-token [--yes] [--model <id>]` — capture a
    `claude setup-token` mint into session-token.json: echo-off rpassword
    paste on a TTY, ONE stdin line when piped (the GUI/script path);
    validate_setup_token (sk-ant- prefix, no interior whitespace, ≥40)
    before any write; atomic 0600; expiresAt stamped now+365d (documented
    lifetime — the mint carries no expiry); scopes recorded. Additive:
    never touches the live slot (takes effect on next switch), usage pair/
    env/chain/models survive; new name → blank profile; existing sidecar →
    confirm or --yes; --setup-token excludes api/codex/--new at parse.
  * Setup-tab `session` row: "static token · expires in ~Nd" (WARNING ≤30d,
    DANGER + "re-mint: claude setup-token" when expired, "no recorded
    expiry" for hand-rolled sidecars). session_token_expiry() reads only
    the sidecar. Upstream branch 1143 green; fork 1294 green; clippy clean
    both. Deployed: cargo install + daemon/proxy restarted.
- ccsbar (01cbcee): context-menu "Install/Replace session token…" → inline
  SecureField banner (validation mirrors clauth's; token piped to
  `clauth login <p> --setup-token --yes` stdin — NEVER argv/ps/logs);
  DetailCard shows the sidecar state under the account email (direct
  sidecar read, CodexProxyMode idiom — daemon-down safe; only expiresAt
  decoded). LoginMode.setupToken joins the single-login guard + flight
  banner. 210+5 tests green; repackaged + redeployed to /Applications.

## 2026-07-19 (WKO-1) — weekly override + long-lived detection/rename + full ccsbar integration

- PR #55 (b12ec28): folded the maintainer's weekly-limit-per-account ask in
  as an OVERRIDE (`weekly at` row; Config-tab `weekly limit` stays the
  chain default; empty commit clears). One per-account line governs the
  aggregate + scoped judgments; NEVER the hard-cap ones. Predicates split
  soft (member_weekly_line/member_scoped_line) vs hard (weekly_hard_blocked/
  is_exhausted_hard); ChainMember snapshots resolved weekly_line/scoped_line;
  is_exhausted_active takes the caller's weekly bool. 1159 green.
- PR #53 (2244a46): maintainer's remaining ask — content-aware long-lived
  detection. `session_token_status`: long-lived IFF no refresh token; a
  mis-filled rotating pair DISENGAGES the split (install source back to
  credentials.json, gate logs the re-capture hint, Setup row shows DANGER
  "not long-lived (has a refresh token) · ignored"). NAMING (AX): user-facing
  term is now **long-lived token** everywhere (claude setup-token's own
  wording; "session token" reads as the opposite) — TUI row keyed `token`;
  sidecar filename session-token.json unchanged. 1144 green.
- FORK main ADOPTED SCW-2+WKO (a108ae0..51c177b): hand-port, not cherry-pick
  (fork fallback.rs diverges — codex harness chains, no freshness pass, no
  spend budget, no burn floor/horizon, wrap_off naming). Codex ChainMembers
  get inert neutral lines. Fork now runs the per-account gate semantics live.
  Daemon grew socket verbs `set_member_weekly` (null clears) /
  `set_check_weekly` / `set_check_scoped` + status.json fallback fields
  check_weekly/check_scoped/weekly_threshold. 1304 green; deployed (cargo
  install + daemon/proxy restart; status.json verified carrying the fields).
- ccsbar (97e114b): context-menu "Weekly limit here ▸" (follow-default/
  presets/custom via ThresholdEditTarget.memberWeekly) + "Check weekly
  usage"/"Check per-model weekly (7d fable)" gate toggles; FallbackInfo
  decodes the new fields with old-daemon defaults (gates ON); long-lived
  rename across all copy. 210+8 tests; repackaged + redeployed.

## 2026-07-20 (UPS-1) — #53 MERGED · #55 review fixes · proxy advisory-rank · #47 committed

- **PR #53 MERGED upstream** (re-authored on mommy as c01a2f6 backend +
  d8105e1 TUI; closes #52). Maintainer stacked claude-driven fixes on merge;
  fork was missing three and has them now (0e3926e): force_snapshot guard
  (the confirmed divergence-Overwrite could clobber a long-lived profile's
  clauth-private usage pair — fork's CAP-1 shape guards the force path
  directly), token-row sub-day-expiry gate (`now >= expiry`, not truncated
  days — "~0d" WARNING mislabel), login completions full flag set
  (--codex/--browser/--setup-token/--yes) + SECURITY.md session-token row.
- **PR #55 CHANGES_REQUESTED → fixed** (eb8394a): 4 hard-cap sites judged at
  member-resolved soft lines after the member_weekly_line refactor —
  next_target's serving-sink passes (the MONEY divergence: TUI twin paid a
  spend-armed sibling while the daemon twin parked free on the sink),
  usage-tab weekly_hard diag, update_banner any_spent. All → is_exhausted_hard/
  weekly_hard_blocked. Added the exact-divergence tests (RED-verified on
  pre-fix code), `weekly at` in ? help modal + chain.rs module doc,
  cargo fmt reflow (CI red). 1161 green; replied on PR. Fork had ONE
  exposed site (any_spent banner; no spend/sink-serving passes) — fixed in
  the same 0e3926e.
- **Codex Plus→Pro incident root-caused** (x@computelabs.ai / ax-codex-cl):
  (1) usage stuck 100% = the window between the upgrade and the first
  DIRECT session — passive JSONL leg had only pre-upgrade events (weekly
  reset days out); self-healed at 14:09Z once direct sessions wrote fresh
  rate_limits (status.json now 1%). (2) proxy-mode "usage limit reached" =
  REAL BUG: cached_exhausted marked members unavailable → all unavailable →
  synthesized 429 without consulting upstream → and as sole usage writer
  while serving, the proxy could never observe the correction (wedge).
  FIXED (82ef6bd): PoolMember.cached_spent is an ADVISORY second tier in
  select_account/next_after_failure — cache-clear members first, spent
  members last, only authoritative exclusion (auth_broken/leased/real-429
  cooldown) 429s the client. proxy-design.md §1.5 synced. (3) tier shows
  "plus" = STALE AT SOURCE: live ~/.codex/auth.json last_refresh 07-16
  (pre-upgrade), claims still plus, access token valid to ~Aug 1 so codex
  won't refresh soon; adopt-back is healthy (stored copy 14 min fresh) —
  fixes itself on codex's next token mint; NOT a clauth bug.
- Fork 1309 green, clippy/fmt clean; deployed (cargo install, daemon PID
  81028 + proxy 81032 restarted, status.json verified). ccsbar 620a321:
  same sub-day-expiry truncation fix in SessionToken.statusLine + test;
  218 tests green; repackaged + redeployed (PID 84523).
- **Issue #47**: maintainer decided daemon should honor `on mismatch`
  (ask → TUI stays) and pinged for implementation. Replied YES — next PR
  after #55 lands: honor Overwrite/NewProfile/Discard through the guarded
  paths, propose 4th option `follow` (proven-sibling switch, port of fork
  layer 1). Rescue layer explicitly kept out of on-mismatch.
- Waiting on maintainer: #55 re-review (defaults still vetoable), #51 (he
  refactors first), #47 option-shape verdict.

## 2026-07-20 (UPS-2) — sustainable sync: true merge of upstream/mommy (70 commits)

AX call: "重新match一波upstream,不只是cherry pick,要 sustainable". Ended the
squash-rebase era — fork main now tracks upstream by periodic true merges
(contract in `docs/fork-sync/SYNC.md`, the durable artifact of this round).
Merge commit `c112469` on `sync/upstream-2026-07-20` → ff'd to main.

- Divergence at merge time: merge-base `1470147` (07-16), upstream +70 /
  fork +33. 32 conflicted files, ~90 hunks. Mechanical hunks applied by a
  per-file decision script; 39 custom hunks hand-composed off 4 parallel
  subsystem briefs (Workflow, opus) + 3 adversarial verifiers (all CLEAN,
  audit trails in the session's workflow journals).
- Adopted upstream wholesale: sessions subsystem (index/resume/info +
  isolated-session rescue), opt-in spend budget (max_spend, spend-armed
  passes, `switch_off_when_budget_spent`), single-usage-snapshot scheduler
  walk (0ba3538 — the free-vs-paid race fix), burn floor/horizon bounds,
  fresh-read two-pass preference, canceled-subscription exclusion,
  settings sync + jsonsync + burn.rs, apiKeyHelper, owner-only dirs,
  wrap_off→switch_off_when_spent rename (status.json key stays `wrap_off`),
  TUI rework (config banding, block-reason pills, session_token_lines,
  reset clocks, max-spend editor).
- Fork re-expressed on the new shapes: SCW-1/2 folded lines ride
  ChainMember beside max_spend; `scoped_blocked_from_usage` replaces the
  store twin; walk = headroom(fresh→any, scoped-gated, member soft lines) →
  serving sink(hard) → spend → dead sink → halt(hard), verified pass-for-pass
  identical across both twins. THREE upstream literal-100 sites converted to
  hard predicates (the #55 bug class under fork folding — `blocked_reason`
  WeeklySpent + both next_target sink sites). `clauth resume` collision:
  known codex profile → carryover, else upstream session resume
  (`cmd_resume_dispatch`). settings sync + env-key union skip codex-harness
  dirs (`is_codex_profile_dir`, new test). Overview route column + usage-tab
  active pill/account rows + keychain-first ordering + CLA-SPLIT guards all
  survived (adversarially verified, not assumed).
- Evidence: 1538 tests green (both parents' suites — upstream's spend tests
  pass against the composed walk, fork's scoped tests against the snapshot
  shape), clippy 0, fmt clean; release binary smoke-tested read-only
  (status.json carries schema 1 + fork fields + 6 profiles; completions
  carry sessions/resume). Deployed same session (daemon + proxy restart).

## 2026-07-21 (CLA-SPLIT-3) — mis-filled sidecar incident: "Login expired" while ccsbar read healthy

Live incident (AX report, ~03:29Z): claude sessions died "Login expired ·
Please run /login" while ccsbar showed ax-main Fresh + "Long-lived token ·
expires in ~342d". Root cause chain, forensically pinned:

1. 07-18 10:05:45Z batch fill wrote all THREE session-token.json as full
   credential-shaped JSON — the RIGHT mints (hash-verified vs
   ~/.claude-fleet/claude_long_live_tokens.env: 1f1b7d5a/d59c050e/fb740963)
   but with a spurious refreshToken + scopes + subscriptionType template.
2. 07-19 genuinely-long-lived detection (159224e, the #53 maintainer ask)
   classifies refresh-token-present sidecars NotLongLived → silently
   DISENGAGED the split on all three profiles retroactively.
3. Switches then fell back to rotating pairs (daemon loglines 07-20 07:41Z
   ax-backup, 14:02Z ax-main) — CC sessions and clauth's usage leg back on
   ONE single-use refresh chain, the exact class CLA-SPLIT exists to kill.
4. 21:19:58Z: the shared pair's access token expired; clauth's usage leg
   rotated first (stored+live-symlink updated — the mtimes are
   microsecond-identical because ~/.claude/.credentials.json is a SYMLINK
   into the profile store); CC's copy of the chain was left spent → its next
   refresh attempt died → Login expired. AX /login'd at 03:30:36Z (Keychain
   acct=xingfanxia mdat matches to the second).
5. ccsbar could not surface any of this: SessionToken.state decoded ONLY
   expiresAt, so a mis-filled sidecar displayed as a healthy ~342d countdown.

Fixes (all deployed 07-21):
- Sidecars re-captured via `clauth login <p> --setup-token --yes` (stdin
  pipe from the fleet env, values never printed); verified pure-mint shape
  {accessToken, expiresAt, scopes} + hash match. Split arms at each
  profile's next switch (AX-manual). Meanwhile the /login chain is safe:
  has_session_token=true now short-circuits the rotation Keychain-mirror.
- ccsbar 7ebe3f9: new SessionTokenState.misfilled (mirrors clauth's
  refresh-token check) → DANGER "mis-filled (rotating pair) — not in
  effect; re-capture", never the stamped countdown. 210+11 tests green,
  deployed + relaunched.

Forensic facts worth keeping: CC on this Mac reads/writes Keychain item
acct=xingfanxia svce="Claude Code-credentials" (an acct=unknown shell from
05-31 is a dead item — ignore it in future forensics); the live credentials
file is a clauth-owned symlink, so "live file == stored" is definitional,
not evidence of a write.

CLA-SPLIT-3 addendum (60f99ea): the sidecar repair itself exposed a second
predicate deadlock — with the install source flipped to session-token.json,
the STALE live symlink (→ credentials.json) classifies Diverged, the
unsaved-credentials gates routed the switch through archive_live_credentials,
and the archive refuses symlinks by design → every switch failed "nothing
unsaved to archive" and deferred forever (AX's ccsbar switch to ax-backup
hung live). Fix: live_login_is_clauth_symlink() exempts clauth-owned
symlinks in both unsaved gates (daemon + TUI) — a symlink's content is a
profile store by construction, nothing unsaved; regular-file live logins
(a real CC /login) archive exactly as before. Regression test pins the
Diverged-but-not-unsaved transition state. 1539 tests, deployed.

CLA-SPLIT-3 upstreamed: the stale-symlink switch-deadlock fix ported onto
upstream/mommy (upstream shares the full shape via merged #53 — their daemon
retries "unsaved credentials" to TTL and the TUI false-prompts; repro is
their own `--setup-token` on the active profile) and opened as PR
[#58](https://github.com/uwuclxdy/clauth/pull/58)
(`fix/stale-sidecar-symlink-divergence`, 1237 tests green). #51/#55/#47
needed no update: #51's head is fork main (auto-updated by today's pushes),
#55 still awaits re-review, #47 unchanged.

## 2026-07-21 (CLA-FEED-1) — daemon-fed session token: Fable-capable long-lived slot

Why: the CLA-SPLIT static setup-token carries only `user:inference
user:sessions:claude_code`, no `subscriptionType` — Claude Code's Fable 5
gate refuses it ("requires usage credits"). AX's "前两天还可以" window was the
mis-fill regression running vanilla (Fable + race deaths); the durable answer
is CLA-FEED (AX picked option B, then the design simplified past dual-grant
when the usage chain turned out to already BE a full-scope max mint — see
docs/cla-feed/DESIGN.md).

Design in one line: the daemon feeds session-token.json with the usage
chain's current access token (real expiry, full scopes, subscriptionType, NO
refresh token) — sessions get Fable-capable bearers, the classifier stays
LongLived so every split guard is unchanged, the refresh chain never leaves
clauth custody, and CC picks up re-stamps because it re-reads the Keychain
per request (verified on-device 2026-07-07, oauth.rs rotation-coherence #1).

Shipped (fork main):
- `Profile.session_feed` (config.toml, default off) + `clauth feed <p> on|off`
  (validates chain Fable-capability, arms immediately, installs live when
  active; off restores the static mint).
- Rotation hook in `apply_rotated_tokens_locked`'s CLA-SPLIT quiet branch:
  feeds on EVERY rotation (parked included; absent sidecar arms; NotLongLived
  mis-fill never overwritten); active profiles ship the fed sidecar through
  the existing post-flock `mirror` Keychain write. State flock is re-entrant
  per-thread (lock.rs:10) so the nested feed write is safe.
- `ensure_installable` feed branches: fresh fed sidecar Ready; stale one
  re-feeds from the stored chain (no spend) or the guarded refresh leg (its
  persist re-feeds via the hook); absent sidecar arms instead of falling
  through to the vanilla-pair install; terminal chain death restores the
  static mint (Ready, degraded) else Broken. `has_live_session` bail exempted
  for feed (fed sessions never advance the chain).
- Static-mint preservation: first feed copies a genuine mint (no refresh, no
  subscriptionType, ≥30d horizon) to `session-token.static.json`; re-mint on
  a feed profile refreshes the backup; `restore_static_mint` round-trips.
- Scheduler: `proactive_rotation_due` feed override (active feed profiles
  rotate inside the lead window regardless of the global toggle or Keychain
  mirror — off macOS the symlinked sidecar IS live).
- Surfaces: status.json additive per-profile `session_feed`; TUI token row
  renders `fed · refreshes in ~Nh` (accent) vs the mint's 30d warning ramp,
  `feed stalled` DANGER when expired; help/completions.
- Tests: 1554 green (feed gate truth table, rotation hook, mint
  preservation/restore, config round-trip, proactive truth-table rows,
  status key inventory). clippy 0, fmt clean.

ccsbar (CLA-FEED-2, pending): render `session_feed` from status.json so a fed
token shows as maintenance, not an expiring mint.

CLA-FEED-1 review round (adversarial workflow, 3 opus dimensions × sonnet
refuters; 10 findings, 9 confirmed, all fixed):
- ensure_installable restructured: feed profiles dispatch to a single
  `feed_install_gate` (vanilla gate restored byte-identical) — a mis-filled
  sidecar HEALS (evidence quarantined to ~/.clauth/quarantine/, static mint
  restored) when a backup exists; without one the disengaged-vanilla posture
  stands, loudly (pinned by two new gate tests).
- Pinned-pair double-spend closed twice: the scheduler's live-session bail
  exemption now requires an ARMED sidecar (`session_feed &&
  has_session_token`), and `clauth start` arms the feed from disk
  (`arm_feed_from_disk` in canonical_credentials, guard-serialized,
  best-effort) so a session can no longer be launched onto the rotating pair
  inside an arming window.
- TOCTOU class: `write_session_token_with_backup` stamps mint+backup from one
  serialized byte buffer in one flock section (re-mint path; replaces the
  read-back `refresh_static_backup`); `feed_from_stored_chain` takes the
  RotationGuard as witness; `clauth feed off` (flag flip + mint restore)
  serializes under the guard.
- `feed_install_gate` refuses to spend when a live session holds an un-armed
  profile (Transient, actionable message); `arm_session_feed` reports arming
  failure instead of a false OK when the sidecar didn't arm.
- Keychain mirror hardening staged: refresh-none content belt on the fed
  mirror; absent-sidecar feed profiles never ship the pair (NotLongLived
  mis-fills deliberately keep the vanilla mirror — that's what keeps CC alive
  while disengaged, CLA-SPLIT-3).
Post-fix gate: 1557 tests green, clippy 0, fmt clean.

CLA-FEED-1 deploy incident (2026-07-22 01:30Z, AX report "切backup失败+被登出"):
a STALE-BINARY WRITER wiped `session_feed` from all three config.tomls hours
after enablement — a `clauth` TUI running since 07-18 (tmux, pre-CLA-FEED
image; binary replaced under it 07-21) plus the un-restarted proxy. Old
ProfileConfig doesn't know the key, so any of its config rewrites drops it
(wipe mtimes 20:11Z/21:23Z/01:31Z each match a daemon "external change"
logline). Flag off → nobody re-fed → ax-backup's fed token expired under the
live session → CC 401 with no refresh token → "Login expired" (AX /login'd);
daemon benched backup ("long-lived token has expired" — the vanilla gate
reading the dead fed token as an expired mint) and auto-switched to ax-main
(static mint → Fable gone). RECOVERY: killed the stale TUI, restarted the
proxy (new image), re-ran `clauth feed on` for backup/cl (re-fed 7h/2h
tokens), re-set ax-main's flag by hand (daemon arms it on next rotation).
LESSONS: (1) binary replacement must restart EVERY clauth process — daemon,
proxy, AND any long-lived TUI (tmux windows!); pgrep by image age, not by
role. (2) config.toml unknown-key wipe by old binaries is a standing hazard —
follow-up: preserve unknown keys in maybe_rewrite_config_toml (toml_edit
round-trip) so future flags survive stale writers.

## 2026-07-22 (CDX-6) — read-only wham/usage polling: parked codex accounts get live usage

AX report: parked codex accounts' usage froze at their last live session
(ax-codex-xfx wore "week spent" days after its weekly reset). Investigation
(3 sibling projects source-read): everyone polls
`GET chatgpt.com/backend-api/wham/usage` with the stored access token — no
live session needed — and codex CLI itself polls the same endpoint ~60s
(openai/codex#10869). AX REVERSED the feasibility §2.5 ban (option A;
cadence "那我们也每分钟刷新"). Bounding fixes shipped first: walk was already
reset-aware; ccsbar spent-pill made reset-aware (b702841).

Shipped (fork main):
- `src/codex/poll.rs`: tolerant wham parse (rate_limit|rate_limits,
  primary_window|primary aliases, resets_at|resets_in_seconds normalize)
  through the SAME route_windows slotting as the passive leg; PollError
  {Unauthorized, RateLimited, Other}; bare headers (Authorization + Accept +
  ChatGPT-Account-Id — no invented UA). READ-ONLY invariant: never refreshes,
  never writes auth; 401 waits for CDX-3.
- `codex_poll_tick` in the scheduler (lease-holder leg after standby): all
  codex profiles, 60s/profile cadence, clock-expired tokens stand down,
  Unauthorized widens 15m, shape-drift widens 1h, same-error log dedup;
  publishes via cache+store+status like every leg.
- `AppState.codex_usage_poll` kill switch, default ON.
- Docs: feasibility §2.5 dated reversal note (accounts/credit endpoints stay
  banned), proxy-design + PLAN non-goal annotations, usage.rs module doc,
  SYNC.md CDX-1..6.
- Tests: 4 parse + 4 tick orchestration (offline, injected poll seam);
  1566 green, clippy 0.

CDX-6 addendum (live-shape + plan tier): first deploy revealed the REAL wham
dialect (reset_at / reset_after_seconds / limit_window_seconds, verdict
top-level) — parser now accepts both dialects, live shape pinned as fixture
(a0a5766). Second AX report: tier label stale after a plan upgrade (plus→pro;
the id_token claim only re-mints on codex's own refresh) — wham's top-level
plan_type now rides the poll into CODEX_PLAN_CACHE_FILE (written on change
only) and tier_label prefers it over the claim. Verified live: xfx 7d=0%
(the reset the stale cache hid), cl 11%, all Fresh at 60s cadence.

## UPS-3 — upstream review rounds served: #58 r2, #55 r2 (rebase), #51 design answer (2026-07-21)

All three open upstream threads carried CHANGES_REQUESTED / questions; both
fix rounds pushed + replied, standing contribute-back authorization.

#58 (fix/stale-sidecar-symlink-divergence, b53226d append, no force):
- reviewer: exemption reached 2 of 5 gates + no defer regression test.
- one `claude::live_diverged_and_unsaved(active)` owns the triple + symlink
  term; daemon/TUI gates + switch_profile_cli + switch_profile_noninteractive
  route through it. poll_credentials_divergence keeps its cascade with the
  atomic symlink early-return (adopt side-effect interleave + 1Hz read cost)
  — deviation disclosed in the reply.
- drain_pending_switch_proceeds_over_a_stale_clauth_symlink +
  divergence_poll_ignores_a_stale_clauth_symlink; both mutation-checked red.
  Delegated to a worktree agent; 1239 green.

#55 (feat/scoped-weekly-walk, eb8394a → 51338fb, force-with-lease after the
requested REBASE onto moved mommy — 4 commits replayed over the store→usage
snapshot rework, ROWS_BEFORE→rows_start, ⊖ consolidation, canceled axis):
- rebase ports: scoped_blocked_from_store→_from_usage, member-based
  is_exhausted_from_usage(member, usage, line), active_canceled joins the
  trigger condition, member_detail 10-arg signature sweep (19 call sites).
- findings fixed on top (3 commits): member_scoped_line rides check_weekly
  (override inert when gate off; scoped stays judged at chain line);
  !active.last_resort parking guard on BOTH scoped triggers (oscillation);
  chip routes worst_scoped_window (= scoped_weekly_blocked_info, no second
  opinion); parse_weekly_override→parse_weekly_pct (50..=100); load boundary
  RESETS out-of-band weekly_threshold to unset (never clamps — 0.98 typo
  class) + kills nan; focused member card scrolls cursored row into view
  (caret subtracts scroll; 40x24 remove-row reachable); ScopedSpent rides ⊘
  warning (◇ retired); edit weekly at naming; default_reminder reuse.
- every discriminator mutation-checked red (6 mutations); 1368 green,
  clippy 0, fmt clean. Both rounds' replies posted as issue comments.

#51: maintainer asked for a clauth mode-switcher design (c codex/c claude).
Answered from fork experience: harness = PROFILE AXIS not app mode;
per-harness active/chain/pending-queue; dispatch points (switch mechanics
session-boundary vs link, single-use rotating refresh single-writer, wham
usage dialect, feature GATING not porting); flagged isolated-CODEX_HOME
auto-start as the missed item; offered incremental upstreaming (axis first)
after #55/#58 land. #47 follow-up (daemon honors on-mismatch + follow)
stays queued behind #55. No new PR opened — nothing else is ripe.

## UPS-4 — #55 MERGED; #58 round-3 (macOS regular-file mirror) (2026-07-22)

- **#55 MERGED into mommy 2026-07-22T13:12Z** (per-model weekly windows +
  per-account gates + `weekly at` override). Fork main already carries the
  feature (SCW-1/2 hand-port); next fork↔upstream sync reconciles to the
  merged form per docs/fork-sync/SYNC.md. #53, #49 previously merged.
- **#58 round-3** (e66b9cb append, no force): maintainer traced a deeper
  macOS steady-state bug — the round-2 exemption keyed on `is_symlink()`, but
  CC rewrites the live slot as a regular-file Keychain mirror after every run,
  so once a sidecar flip makes classify read Diverged the switch defers again.
  Fix: `live_login_is_clauth_symlink` → `live_login_is_stored(active)` =
  content match against BOTH stored files (credentials.json + session-token.json;
  covers both flip directions) OR a structural symlink clause (dangling case).
  SECOND site found via an end-to-end daemon test: `switch_profile`'s
  `uncaptured_relogin` ran the same triple WITHOUT the exemption → macOS mirror
  took the guarded-link path and byte-rejected the switch even after the gate
  passed. Routed it through `live_diverged_and_unsaved` too. Regression: cross-
  platform regular-file-mirror cases on helper + daemon-drain + 1Hz-poll (all
  red without the content half; daemon also reds if uncaptured_relogin keeps the
  raw triple), symlink cases kept, dangling-symlink assertion added. 1242 green,
  clippy/fmt clean. Replied disclosing the both-stores deviation + the second
  site. Awaiting re-review.
- **#51** still awaiting maintainer on the mode-switcher design answer (harness
  = profile axis). No new PR ripe.

## UPS-5 — #58 MERGED; #51 codex-mode proposals answered (2026-07-23)

- **#58 APPROVED + MERGED 2026-07-23T09:08Z** ("This is it... lgtm ✅").
  Maintainer endorsed the round-3 content-based rework verbatim, including
  the both-stores deviation ("strictly wider, same cost") and the
  uncaptured_relogin second-site fix he'd waved through as fine in R1/R2.
  Both #55 and #58 now in mommy → fork↔upstream sync is DUE (true merge,
  reconcile #55 to merged form + #58 to merged form, hard-cap sweep) per
  docs/fork-sync/SYNC.md. Not started.
- **#51: maintainer moved the codex-mode design forward** (2026-07-23):
  proposed CODEX_HOME repoint to profile dirs + `clauth start {codex
  account}`, asked to rebase the branch on v0.14 when it lands, asked us to
  review his codex-mode changes, and proposed `{name}-cc`/`{name}-c` dir
  suffixes. Answered from CDX-1b experience
  (https://github.com/uwuclxdy/clauth/pull/51#issuecomment-5063434276):
  CODEX_HOME → `profiles/{name}/codex-home/` subdir (auth.json seeded from
  store, config.toml COPY not symlink, isolated sessions/) + the sharp edges
  (canonicalize, env scrub, file-store-mode check, TWO-CARRIER refusal,
  60s adopt-back watchdog); v0.14 rebase agreed via a dedicated branch cut
  from v0.14 ported incrementally (PR head is fork main — never rewritten in
  place); suffixes: keep typed `harness` field authoritative (suffix =
  naming convention, not parsed discriminator), suffix only the codex side
  for back-compat, offer `-cx` over `-c`. Awaiting maintainer.
- **#47 follow-up** (daemon honors on-mismatch + `follow`) now fully
  unblocked (#55 and #58 both landed). Not started.

## UPS-6 — fork↔upstream sync: v0.13.0 + v0.13.1 merged (2026-07-23)

- **True merge `45f2f43`** (sync/upstream-2026-07-23 → ff main, pushed; PR #51
  head auto-updated). ~60 upstream commits, 34 conflicted files.
- **Reconciled to merged forms**: #55 (fork's SCW hand-port → upstream's
  ChainMember snapshot shape, `is_exhausted_from_usage(member, usage, line)`,
  `worst_scoped_window`, parse_weekly_pct band, weekly-at scoped-line gate
  semantics) and #58 (fork's round-1 `live_login_is_clauth_symlink` DELETED →
  upstream's final `live_login_is_stored` + `live_diverged_and_unsaved`
  everywhere).
- **Adopted upstream features, gated through fork axes**: account-disable
  toggle (codex backstop lives in `ensure_switch_target_ok` — codex bail
  BEFORE disabled check; fork route/email cells joined the disabled dim
  flatten), daemon singleton cap (`--status`/`--standby`/`--replace`, pid
  sidecar; fork per-harness switch_backoff map kept), clap-derive CLI
  (`src/cli.rs` extended with Fallback/Feed/Proxy/Doctor variants + login
  `--new`/`--codex`/`--browser`; hand parsers deleted; print_help deleted),
  d954fb6 non-login capture guards PORTED into fork's CAP-1 shape (non-force
  None leg no longer clears the store; force path skips absent/shell; CAP-1
  first-login leg now requires a non-empty token — upstream's 92c56e7),
  5h post-reset repoll, walk_excluded shared skip predicate, finite_pct /
  weekly reset-not-clamp load normalization.
- **Test reconciliation strategy** (the bulk of the work): per-file whole-file
  rebuilds — upstream base + fork-only blocks (claude, cli, fallback, oauth,
  profile, tui_render_format/overview/usage) or FORK base + upstream blocks
  where src kept fork shapes (daemon_mod, daemon_status_json); scheduler
  recovery tests adapted HashSet→VecDeque; upstream tests adapted to fork
  signatures (render_overview_row 6-arg, OverviewWidths 3-arg, HeaderState
  is_active/account_email, LiveSignals last_error/last_switch, build_status
  4-arg, per-harness stage_switch). Superseded fork tests dropped (round-1
  #58 suite, hand-parser CLI suite, blocked_pill PILL_LINES test).
- **Deploy**: plist template + live LaunchAgent now run `daemon --standby`
  (upstream's new exit-if-running default would strand a launchd respawn race
  as a clean exit KeepAlive never restarts). Binary replaced via fresh inode
  (in-place cp = SIGKILL, macOS signature kill). Daemon (pid --standby) +
  proxy restarted, status.json fresh, all fork wire keys verified present.
- Gates: 1773 green, clippy 0, fmt clean, hard-cap sweep clean.

## EXP-1 — login-expiry root-cause research (3-agent, 2026-07-23)

Reports: external (codexbar/codex-auth/CRS/cc-switch + vendor issues), local
forensics (daemon.log 07-10..23 + metadata-only cred inspection), codex-auth
deep study. Consolidated verdict:

- **Universal law** (vendor-confirmed both sides): refresh tokens are
  single-use rotating with reuse detection — openai/codex #15410/#15502/#6498
  (codex), claude-code #24317 + CodexBar #1161 (claude). Access-token TTL is
  NEVER the killer; a second holder of the chain is. Mature projects converge
  on "exactly one writer rotates-and-writes-back; everyone else read-only".
- **Codex `ax-codex-cl` death (07-23 20:36) fully explained**: parked chain
  minted 07-16, externally rotated/revoked (~07-23 09:27 wham 401); direct-mode
  default bypasses the proxy so adopt-back never saw the rotation; RC-2: standby
  refresh is AGE-scheduled (48h-to-expiry / 7d) — a wham 401 does NOT
  accelerate it (scheduler.rs:2751-2758 uncoupled from codex/oauth.rs:181-194),
  so the death stayed masked ~11h; RC-3: auth_broken = no self-recovery.
- **Claude "revoked" deaths (07-16..22) = CLA-SPLIT-3 regression** (split
  disengaged by mis-filled sidecar → CC raced the usage chain). Healed on disk
  07-21/22; 1.6 days clean since. Ongoing exposures: RC-B external co-consumer
  of the usage chain (structural, non-fatal to sessions post-split) and RC-C
  fed-sidecar 7h clock-death across daemon idle gaps (re-feed is ONLY a
  rotation side effect, oauth.rs:1040-1066; no independent timer; multi-hour
  idle windows + fetch-lease contention observed). Discriminator for the next
  death: "refresh token revoked" = RC-B; "login expired / long-lived token
  expired" = RC-C.
- **codex-auth study**: clauth ahead on all core mechanics (locking, rotation
  guard, isolated homes, proxy fallback); worth adopting = versioned --json
  contract discipline, bulk `import --codex`, `switch --previous`; explicitly
  NOT: lockless file-copy swap, codext CLI fork, config injection, curl client.
- **Proposed fixes (not started)**: F1 health-triggered codex standby (wham
  401 → immediate guarded refresh attempt); F2 CLA-FEED independent re-feed
  timer + wake-from-sleep check (+ verify clock-death degrade to static mint);
  F3 codex self-heal re-capture (live ~/.codex login matching an auth_broken
  profile's account → auto re-adopt); F4 codex-auth UX adoptions.

## EXP-2 — F1+F2 implemented: 401-kicked codex standby + claude re-feed timer (2026-07-23)

The two "small and certain" fixes from EXP-1, shipped together:

- **F1 (codex, RC-2 fix)**: CDX-6 poll's `PollError::Unauthorized` now inserts
  the profile into `SchedulerState.codex_auth_kicks` (shared leaf mutex); the
  CDX-3 standby tick drains kicks BEFORE its scan gate and calls
  `codex_refresh_parked(..., force: true)`. `force` bypasses ONLY the
  `standby_due` age check (the 401 is server-side proof of death); candidates
  membership (parked/clauth-held — live owners excluded), RotationGuard, and
  the apply-time chain-identity re-check all stay. Kicks bypass both the scan
  cadence and the 6h transient widening (poll's 15-min unauthorized cadence is
  the upstream rate limit). Permanent → auth_broken as before, but now within
  ~1 poll interval of the revocation instead of masked for days.
- **F2 (claude, RC-C fix)**: new scheduler leg `claude_feed_tick` (5-min scan,
  lease-holder only) + `oauth::refeed_session_token`: for every feed-enabled
  profile whose fed sidecar is within `FEED_REFEED_HORIZON_MS` (2h) of clock
  death, run the FULL existing feed decision table — no-spend re-stamp from a
  comfortable chain / guarded refresh / mint degrade — via a new
  `fresh_horizon_ms` param threaded through `feed_install_gate`,
  `feed_from_stored_chain`, `gate_under_guard`. Switch-time callers pass the
  old `AUTH_GATE_GRACE_MS` (60s) so switch behavior is byte-identical. Active
  profile no-spend re-stamps also mirror the refresh-less bearer to the
  Keychain under the config mutex (the rotation-hook discipline; running
  claude re-reads Keychain per request). Due predicate is stateless wall-clock
  → machine-sleep gaps self-correct on the first tick after wake; predicate
  (exp <= now+H) and gate freshness (exp > now+H) are complementary, so no
  scan no-op loop.
- Tests: +10 (4 kick orchestration, 3 feed-tick orchestration, 3 refeed
  gate-level incl. the switch-gate-vs-refeed contrast). 1783 green, clippy 0,
  fmt clean, hard-cap sweep clean.
- Still open from EXP-1: F3 codex self-heal re-capture (CDX-7 scale), F4
  codex-auth UX adoptions (json contract / import / switch --previous).
  F4-routing decision (AX delegated): direct default STAYS; RC-1 exposure is
  accepted until F3 lands (self-heal re-capture is the mitigation, not proxy
  re-route).
- Review round (opus code-reviewer): 0 CRIT / 0 HIGH / 1 MED / 4 LOW / 1 NIT,
  all fixed: MED = kick circuit breaker (`kick_streak` in CodexPollPacing,
  cap 2 consecutive 401s without a poll success — a wham-only auth quirk can
  no longer rotate a healthy chain every 15 min forever; genuine dead chains
  still exit via Permanent→auth_broken); LOW = degrade-masked Ready now paces
  like a transient (still-due after Ready → FEED_RETRY_MS widen), poisoned
  pacing can no longer drop drained kicks (gate checked before drain),
  refeed Keychain mirror holds the config guard across the write
  (rotation-hook discipline), all-feed-profiles scan documented as intended;
  +3 tests (kick-permanent termination, breaker stand-down/re-arm,
  degrade pacing) → 1786 green.

## UPS-7 — upstream adopted the codex design as its own spec; we own the build (2026-07-25)

**#51 was NOT merged.** The maintainer distilled the PR-#51 design conversation
into an upstream spec — `docs/codex-plan.md`, commit `3d42fd5`, on `mommy` —
verified the codex-specific claims against `codex 0.145.0` with source refs,
and handed the implementation to us: contributor owns groundwork + codex engine
end to end, on a branch cut from the **v0.14 tag** (not yet released; latest is
v0.13.1), shipped as a six-part reviewable series. Maintainer designs + reviews.
AX accepted (option A, 2026-07-25).

**Their pinned decisions that diverge from the fork** (we adopt theirs; this is
a state-layer rewrite, not a rebase):

| | fork today | spec |
|---|---|---|
| harness location | `Profile.harness` in per-profile `config.toml`; `active_codex_profile` / `codex_fallback_chain` in `AppState` (`profile.rs:495-507`) | a separate `~/.clauth/codex-profiles.toml`; harness = which FILE the name came from |
| profile dir | bare (`profiles/<name>`) | `-cx` suffix (`profiles/<name>-cx`) |
| codex store mode | refuse unless `file` (`runtime.rs:247`) | force `-c cli_auth_credentials_store="file"` on every spawn |

The three are causally linked: `-cx` (maintainer wants it because the agent sees
the path in its system prompt) makes the dir path depend on the harness, so the
harness can no longer live in a file inside the dir, so it must go to shared
state — and putting it in `AppState` reopens the mixed-version write-hole, hence
the separate file. Their reasoning holds; both their calls are better than ours.

**Reply posted** (#51 comment `5077575647`) — acceptance + 6 gaps + all 9 open
questions answered from production evidence:

- *gap 1 (the one that matters)*: spec phase 4 inherits AGE-scheduled standby
  refresh, which EXP-1 proved blind to the real death mode. Recommended the
  EXP-2 F1 shape (`PollError::Unauthorized` → kick set → force-refresh
  bypassing only the age gate, 2-strike breaker).
- *gap 2*: decision 5 covers spawn but not CAPTURE — `clauth login --codex`
  reads the operator's real `~/.codex/auth.json`, absent under keyring; the
  fork's `actions.rs:1386` refusal stays, only the spawn-side one goes.
- *gap 3*: their `enforce_clauth_perms` codex-home exemption needs its other
  half (skip DESCENT, keep the dir at 0700, credential mode owned by
  `atomic_write_600`). **Fork had the identical bug — fixed this session.**
- *gap 4*: seed/adopt-back must move `auth.json` as an opaque blob —
  re-serializing drops `last_refresh` and makes a seeded codex self-refresh on
  startup, racing the daemon for the same chain (two-carrier death at seed).
- *gap 5*: the mixed-version window is silent (#57's singleton keeps the old
  daemon); publish `clauth_version` in status.json (fork already does) + a
  one-line CLI warning.
- *Q1* delegate cut from the series (no production evidence; `codex exec`
  output contract ≠ `claude -p`). *Q2* allowlist-symlink the operator's
  `skills/rules/agents/templates/references/AGENTS.md`, copy `config.toml`
  (MCP rides it), isolate all writable state; `hooks.json` excluded by default.
  *Q3* reuse the named window model, map by duration (`route_windows`,
  `codex/usage.rs:302`). *Q4* auto-start is claude-only. *Q5* SOLVED — the
  `wham/usage` body carries a live top-level `plan_type` (`codex/poll.rs:64-68`)
  that supersedes the stale id_token claim. *Q6* proxy deferred; advisory-rank
  lesson passed on. *Q7* reimplement PKCE, never shell out to `codex login`
  (it writes the LIVE auth.json → forks the chain), + 5 wire traps.
  *Q8* disambiguate by file, name both harnesses in the error, add an explicit
  `--codex`/`--claude` override. *Q9* exclude codex from the Tokens tab.

**Shipped this session (fork):** the gap-3 fix — `enforce_clauth_perms` no
longer DESCENDS into `profiles/<name>/codex-home/` (`is_isolated_codex_home`
matches on the grandparent being the profiles root, so a profile literally
named `codex-home` is still swept). The dir node still tightens to 0700;
nothing loosens, since the seed writes `codex-home/auth.json` through
`atomic_write_600`. Without the guard a single `clauth which` stripped the exec
bit off codex's PATH-alias helper binaries under a RUNNING isolated session
(`load_config` sweeps on every entry point). RED verified (0o600 vs 0o755)
before the fix went in. Also corrected the now-stale CDX-6 module doc that
still claimed a 401 "just waits" for the standby refresh — EXP-2 made it kick.
1787 green, clippy 0, fmt clean.

**Next**: blocked on the v0.14 tag. Re-verify the spec's phase-1 line anchors
against `mommy` HEAD when the branch is cut (the plan says approximate).

## UPS-8 — CLA-FEED contributed upstream as PR #59 (2026-07-25)

Picked while blocked on the v0.14 tag: shrink the fork delta with the piece
that has real upstream value and that upstream can actually test (claude-side,
unlike the codex engine).

**The pick was wrong the first time, and the inventory is why.** `SYNC.md`
listed "browser OAuth login" as a fork-only Claude-side feature, so it was the
obvious first contribution. Measuring instead of reading: upstream HAS
`src/oauth_login.rs` on `mommy` with the whole flow inline (PKCE, percent
codecs, loopback server). The fork's only delta there is the CDX-3 R4
extraction into `src/loopback.rs` so codex's login can share it — which rides
along with the codex series and was never upstreamable alone. Corrected in
SYNC.md (`aaef926`) with a standing instruction to `git grep` against
`upstream/mommy` before trusting a line in that inventory.

Re-measured every fork-only module against `upstream/mommy` — 0 upstream files
match `doctor`, `session_feed`, `tokens.json`, or `socket`; 34 match
`fallback`, so `fallback_config.rs` is an extension, not a feature. That made
**CLA-FEED** the pick: genuine feature, direct sequel to merged #53, fixes a
problem every upstream user of the split hits (the mint carries no
`subscriptionType`, so plan-gated models get capped).

**PR #59** — branch `feat/session-token-feed` cut from `upstream/mommy` per the
contributing template, two-commit reviewable series:

1. `832ed33` feed core — `session_feed` flag, `feed_install_gate` (the six-state
   decision table), rotation hook, `clauth feed <p> on|off` + completions,
   start-time arming, degrade ladder (`session-token.static.json`), mis-fill
   quarantine/heal, additive `session_feed` in status.json, fed-aware TUI token
   row, README + SECURITY.md.
2. `9ac36f7` the re-feed timer — `claude_feed_tick` 5-min scan +
   `refeed_session_token`, `fresh_horizon_ms` threaded through the feed gates
   so switch paths keep the tight 60s grace byte-identical.

**Port shape (not a copy):** upstream's typed clap variant instead of the
fork's `trailing_var_arg` grammar; `is_codex()` guard dropped (no harness
upstream); `proactive_rotation_due` gains only the `feed` param, NOT the fork's
`active_diverged` (separate delta); "Fable-capable" generalized to
"plan-gated" — a model name in someone else's repo ages badly; the
`archive_live_credentials` intra-doc link (fork-only symbol) rewritten to prose.

**Behavior-preserving by construction, not inspection:** `vanilla_install_gate`
is the old `ensure_installable` body verbatim; `expiring` delegates to
`horizon_expiring(.., AUTH_GATE_GRACE_MS)`; `(enabled && keychain_live || false)`
collapses to the old predicate — pinned by two added flag-off assertions.

**Gates:** 1479 passed / 0 failed, clippy `-D warnings` clean, fmt clean;
commit 1 green on its own (1472) so the series bisects. +25 tests.

Two drift-guards fired and were fed rather than silenced — the status.json key
contract and the README↔test `FEATURE_MAP`; the completions test caught that
three shell scripts needed the new subcommand. Two self-inflicted defects from
carving the series were caught by clippy `-D warnings` (an orphaned F2 test
helper, and a `#[test]` attribute eaten by the cut) and fixed before the PR.

**Next upstream candidates**, in order: `clauth doctor` (717 LOC, 0 upstream
footprint, but `mod.rs` has 54 codex refs to gate first), then the daemon
socket + `tokens.json` feed (our ccsbar/ccu contract — upstream may not want
it). Still blocked-on-v0.14: the codex series (UPS-7).

## UPS-9 — upstream round: v0.14.0 out, #59 review round 1, codex spec v2 (2026-07-30)

**v0.14.0 released 2026-07-29** ("i'll release v0.14 now, take your time" on
#59) — WITHOUT #59, so the stated branch order from the 07-27 #51 comment
("#59 lands first, then v0.14 gets cut, then you branch from the tag") no
longer holds literally; confirm the actual codex-series branch point with the
maintainer in the next #59 round (likely: mommy after #59 merges, since #59
rewrites `ensure_installable` into the dispatch phase 2 wraps).

**#59 changes-requested (2026-07-27).** Full text on the PR; the spine:

- **Rename `feed` → `rolling-token` / `static-token`** verbs (config +
  status.json key `rolling_token`, marker CLA-ROLL) — "feed" collides with the
  status feed vocabulary already in the codebase. His 07-29 follow-up floats
  `clauth <p> --rolling-token` as an alternative surface — answer both.
- Blockers: (1) zsh completion apostrophe (`profile's`) breaks ALL zsh
  completion — grammar-walk test can't see it; add shell `-n` parse legs;
  (2) `arm_feed_from_disk` writes a PRE-RotationGuard token snapshot — re-read
  after acquire; (3) a mint inside the 30d horizon is overwritten with no
  backup; (4) the branch is 67 commits behind and mommy centralized rotation
  refusals into `runtime::rotation_blocked_for` — the scheduler exemption must
  move inside it (hand-resolve; either side wholesale is wrong-but-green).
- Majors: timer candidates must come from `enabled_profiles()`;
  `has_session_token` reads the sidecar now, not what the live session
  started from; quarantine dir landed 0755 (delete the `create_dir_all`);
  `cmd_api_key`'s doc comment reattached to `cmd_feed`.
- Tests: the feed-axis expiry conjunct is unpinned (a `feed ||` short-circuit
  survives the suite) — add tuples with expiry outside the window and `None`.
- **The discriminator is ours to call**: mint-vs-fed inference (30d horizon +
  `subscriptionType`) is buggy on both sides of the horizon. Either drop
  `session-token.static.json` (restore = re-mint via `--setup-token`) or keep
  it with an explicit marker OUTSIDE the sidecar wire shape.

**#51 codex spec v2 (rewritten 2026-07-27 against mommy HEAD).** Four flips,
all improvements: `-cx` dropped (bare dirs, names globally unique across both
state files); seed/adopt-back DELETED — per-session home `auth.json` is a
symlink to `profiles/<name>/auth.json` (codex-0.145 writes in place through
symlinks and re-reads before spending, so one physical file makes concurrent
carriers safe); codex self-refreshes on the ACCESS token clock (5-min
pre-expiry window — clauth stands down inside it), not day-scale. All 6 of our
gaps taken; 4 claude-side latent fixes folded into the series; maintainer runs
clean-rust refactors in parallel on mommy (phase-1 state type must NOT mirror
AppState's public slots). Key doc: `upstream/mommy:docs/codex-plan.md` — the
07-24 revision is stale, do not implement from it.

**Codex app collision (AX report, this session):** the Codex desktop app
shares `~/.codex` with the CLI (it writes `.codex-global-state.json` there),
so the fork's live-slot writes — `clauth <codex-profile>` switch,
`clauth resume <codex-profile>`, and CDX-4 auto-switch (`daemon/tick.rs`
`codex_switch_profile`) — flip the app's account too. Today's mitigation:
live stays pinned on `ax-codex-xfx` (`codex_fallback_chain` is unset so the
daemon never auto-flips), and other accounts run via `clauth start <p>`
(isolated CODEX_HOME, live untouched). The v2 spec dissolves the class:
clauth never writes `~/.codex` at all.

## UPS-10 — #59 round 2 shipped: rebased onto v0.14.0, renamed, all blockers closed (2026-07-31)

**PR #59 head is now `5db71ce`, 3 commits on `v0.14.0`, `mergeStateStatus: CLEAN`**
(was `CONFLICTING`, 151 behind). Force-pushed; pre-rebase head preserved as
`origin/backup/feed-pre-rebase-2026-07-31` (`9ac36f7`). Local gate at the head:
`cargo test` 1743 passed / 0 failed / 2 ignored, clippy `-D warnings` clean,
`fmt --check` clean. Commit 1 green alone (1706), commit 2 (1740) — the series
still bisects, which the maintainer asked for.

**The stack (2 commits → 3, AX authorized the restructure):**

1. `856c593 refactor(runtime): narrow the live-session rotation refusal to what
   the session holds` — ZERO rolling-token code, stands alone, improves plain
   #53 profiles too. This is the blocker-4 answer, and it turned out bigger
   than "move the exemption inside `rotation_blocked_for`": the exemption
   should not be about this feature at all. `rotation_blocked_for` now reads
   `live_session_holds_rotatable`, which asks what each live session LAUNCHED
   on. New `LiveSession.launch_store` field (the PATH, not a verdict —
   `heal_misfilled_sidecar` proves sidecar CONTENT changes under a running
   session, so a bool frozen at acquire would permit the exact rotation the
   refusal stops). Fail-closed on every unknown; 7 tests, one macOS-gated to
   pin the WIRING (mutation-verified: deleting the conjunct leaves the other
   six green).
2. `85b9965 feat(claude): rolling session token …` — the feature under its
   final name.
3. `5db71ce test(completions): parse every completion script in its own shell`
   — bash -n / zsh -n / fish --no-execute, + CI installs zsh+fish and sets
   `CLAUTH_REQUIRE_SHELL_LINT=1` so a skip cannot masquerade as a pass under
   nextest (which discards passing-test output).

**Rename `feed` → `rolling-token`/`static-token` done** (198 identifier
occurrences + prose sweep). Two verbs, not `on|off` — answered his 07-29
`clauth <p> --rolling-token` question with grammar evidence: the bare form is
`external_subcommand` and exits 2 on a second token (pinned by two tests), it
is a MUTATING switch, and every other per-profile toggle has zero CLI surface
except the `disable`/`enable` VERB pair. **`#[serde(alias = "session_feed")]`
is load-bearing** — without it `serde(default)` eats the old key and the next
`render_config_toml` drops it: flag gone, sidecar still live, nothing
re-stamping it. That is the CLA-SPLIT-3 silent-disengage class itself.

**Discriminator answered (AX's call: keep the backup).** Marker is a SIBLING
FILE `<profile>/session-token.kind` (`mint`|`rolling`), NOT a ProfileConfig
key — a config field would put a new failure mode on the `--setup-token`
capture path that non-rolling profiles also take, drag in `load_profile` →
`recover_pending_credentials`, and be DROPPED (not ignored) by an older binary.
Ordering rule: *the marker may only read `mint` while the sidecar has
definitely been a mint since it was written* — rolling marks BEFORE, mint marks
AFTER, so a crash always lands on the cheap side. **UNMARKED is a third state**
falling back to the old heuristic, NOT to `mint`: every field sidecar predates
the marker, and resolving unmarked→mint would let the first post-upgrade
rotation snapshot an in-flight rolling bearer as the permanent degrade backup.

**Blocker 2** (pre-guard snapshot) fixed with a post-guard re-read + re-checked
freshness gate. Note: the FIRST regression test passed against unfixed code —
it only advanced the chain before the leg started. The real test holds the
`RotationGuard` on the test thread while the arming thread parks in `acquire`.

**Other majors:** timer candidates → `enabled_profiles()`; `cmd_feed` never
called `refuse_if_disabled` (found while checking — arming a disabled profile
made a bearer nothing would re-stamp); quarantine `create_dir_all` deleted
(0755 dir receiving rotating pairs); `cmd_api_key` doc comment reattached;
`arm_rolling_token`'s postcondition used `has_session_token` and printed a LIE
on the three degrade paths — now reads the marker back. 10 em-dashes in output
macros rewritten (he undercounted by 3). Fork-private `EXP-1/F2`, `RC-C` labels
and a dangling `CodexStandbyPacing` intra-doc link removed for upstreamability.

**Test arithmetic answered:** 1471 (Linux) + 9 macOS-only − 1 Linux-only = 1479.

**Doc debt closed:** `wiki/daemon.md` had NO row for the published key (every
other per-profile field has one); `SECURITY.md` gained the scope-widening
bullet + `session-token.kind` row; README feature bullet rewritten (it is the
source `feature_coverage.rs` parses, so the rename reds that test until both
move together).

**Deployment coupling to watch:** the fork's deployed binary is built from
`main`, which still writes `session_feed` in status.json. ccsbar decodes
`session_feed` leniently (`decodeIfPresent ?? false`), so **when this lands in
fork main, ccsbar must rename its coding key in the same window** or a rolling
token renders through the MINT's 30-day ramp — healthy credential shown as
dying, the exact display gap of 2026-07-20. `ccu` is unaffected (never read the
key) but note its schema gate is `!=`, not `>`, so SCHEMA_VERSION must NOT be
bumped — it wasn't.

**#51:** replied with the branch-point question (v0.14.0 shipped without #59,
so his stated order is void; proposed cutting from mommy after #59 merges,
fallback = branch from the tag and start phase 1, which touches no credential
path). Plus three substantive additions: (a) the symlink design makes codex a
NON-ATOMIC writer of the profile's only copy of the chain (`storage.rs` is
truncate+write, no rename) — a crash mid-write wedges a file whose loss costs a
browser re-login exactly like `refresh_token_reused`, proposed a
never-linked last-known-good copy; (b) codex session rows MUST set
`launch_store` or every live codex session blocks rotation for its profile
under the new predicate; (c) the 5-min stand-down + the health kick deadlock a
PARKED chain (no codex process → nobody refreshes → 401 → kick → stand-down →
breaker trips on a healthy chain), so scope the stand-down to profiles with a
live codex session.

**Windows CI caught a real pre-existing upstream bug (a38a075).** The first push
went red on `check / windows-latest` only, in
`fake_mode_second_session_does_not_rebuild_the_tree`, with `copy_file` failing
`os error 32` ("used by another process") on a `.tmp.<pid>.<seq>` staging
sibling. NOT ours and NOT a flake to retry away: `union_children` already skips
staging siblings for the watchdog mirror and its comment says exactly why, but
`copy_tree` — which `build_runtime_dir` walks on a second acquire — had no such
skip. There the consequence is worse because that walk PROPAGATES its error, so
the whole `ProfileRuntime::acquire` fails instead of a tick re-converging. The
same test passed in the RELEASE leg minutes earlier on the same runner, which is
the signature of a race rather than a break. Fixed with the same predicate at
every recursion level; mutation-verified.

Lesson for next time: the fork develops on macOS and the Windows leg is the only
place `LinkMode::Fake` (recursive copy instead of symlinks) is exercised at all,
so fake-mode races are invisible locally by construction.

**Self-review pass on the shipped diff found 5 more real defects (3d8dab8).**
Four adversarial lenses (concurrency / rename-regression / credentials /
upstreamability), each finding verified against source before acting; 9 of 16
survived verification. The ones that mattered:

1. **The marker ordering rule had an exception I asserted it did not.** "A crash
   between the sidecar write and the marker write costs at worst a skipped
   backup the next write repairs" is FALSE on the two RESTORE paths, which
   CONSUME the backup — a stale `rolling` over a just-restored mint makes the
   next roll skip the snapshot and overwrite the only copy. Fixed twice: restores
   mark BEFORE removing the backup and propagate; and `preserve_static_mint`
   gives content a VETO in the destructive direction only (mint-SHAPED sidecar
   preserved whatever the marker says). The reverse veto would be wrong.
2. TUI token row keyed off the config FLAG not the marker → a dead-chain degrade
   rendered a year-scale mint as "rolling · re-stamps in ~8760h", permanently.
3. `clauth rolling-token` on a DEAD chain exited 0 saying "the daemon retries".
4. `cmd_static_token` reintroduced the "mid-rotation, retry" misdiagnosis
   upstream had already retired — in a line written in the same round that
   quoted that correction back at him. `acquire` BLOCKS; contention never
   surfaces there.
5. Quarantined mis-fills (rotating pairs) lived in a GLOBAL `~/.clauth/quarantine/`
   and survived `clauth delete <profile>`. Moved under the profile dir.

**Process lessons worth keeping:**
- **A regression test can pass against the unfixed code.** The first
  blocker-2 test only advanced the chain BEFORE the leg started, which is not
  the interleaving; it passed under mutation. The real one holds the
  `RotationGuard` on the test thread while the arming thread parks in
  `acquire`. Mutation-test every regression test, not just the fix.
- Same again on the marker: a test asserting "a failed mark degrades to
  UNMARKED" passed vacuously (the induced failure made the cleanup fail too),
  so the defensive line was deleted and replaced with the testable content veto.
- **Windows CI is the only place `LinkMode::Fake` runs at all**, so fake-mode
  races are invisible on macOS by construction. The first fix attempt covered
  `copy_tree`'s recursion but NOT `build_runtime_dir`'s top-level walk, so it
  did not fix its own motivating incident and Windows failed identically twice.

## UPS-11 — #59 round 3: the scopes classifier ends the marker; #51 unblocked; ccsbar decoupled (2026-08-02)

**PR #59 head is `088001a`, 7 commits on `mommy` (`ccdad87`).** Round-2 review
(2026-07-31 13:48) verified every round-1 fix landed, took the mint exemption
("feed-agnostic was the right instinct"), ruled the `session_feed` alias DROPPED,
and left one arm open plus a page of smaller findings. All addressed; round-3
reply posted (`issuecomment-5159564417`), PR body rewritten. Local gate:
1767/0/2, clippy `-D warnings`, fmt. The branch had gone DIRTY (mommy moved 5
commits past v0.14.0 — the `preferred` return-to-home feature both-added fields
next to `rolling_token` in 13 files; all conflicts were keep-both pairs).

**The centerpiece: `session-token.kind` is DELETED, not patched.** The
maintainer observed the discriminating signal already on disk — every sidecar
ever written carries either `SETUP_TOKEN_SCOPES` (2 entries) or the chain's
grant — and proposed folding it into `mint_shaped`. Taken to its conclusion:
`sidecar_kind_of` classifies content exactly (rolling ⇔ plan stamp or any
scope beyond the setup pair; expiry NEVER consulted, so hand-edited
`expiresAt` cannot reclassify), `stamp_rolling_token` refuses a grant that
would classify Mint (totality at the only rolling writer — a chain shaped
like that could never have polled usage, per the #52 403 fact), and the
marker file, `mark_sidecar`/`clear_sidecar_mark`, the ordering rule, the
content veto, `MINT_HORIZON_MS`, and `mint_shaped` are all gone. The
justification is the maintainer's own alias ruling: the marker never shipped
in any release either. One classifier now feeds `preserve_static_mint`,
`sidecar_summary`, the gate's rolling-fresh test, the TUI, and status.json.

**Everything else in the round-3 commit (`aec85c1`):**
- status.json `rolling_token` publishes what the sidecar HOLDS (sidecar_summary,
  the TUI's source), never the config flag — "the one that matters most".
  wiki/daemon.md row rewritten to truth semantics.
- The three unpinned fixes pinned + mutation-verified: build_snap/build_status
  truth pins; `launch_store` exact-path assert in the acquire test (kills both
  the `None` and the fails-OPEN runtime-side-copy mutations); horizon-revert
  mutation reds SIX tests across three modules.
- The sleep-based arming test is EXACT now: `arm_rolling_from_disk_synced`
  seam (injected closure between pre-guard read and `acquire`) + a Barrier;
  a second test pins the NEW post-guard chain-staleness re-check with a
  re-taken clock.
- Alias dropped + test inverted (`session_feed = true` pins to OFF).
- `ClaudeRollingPacing` behind `RankedMutex` (new leaf rank `RollingPacing =
  1400`), field renamed `claude_rolling`; quarantined chains take the Broken
  leash on every verdict (flag read AFTER the gate); `restore_static_mint`
  errors loud; `serving_desc` replaces the three unconditional "the mint"
  loglines; `RollAttempt::Fed`→`Stamped`, `FEED_ARM_GRACE_MS`→`ROLLING_ARM_...`;
  residual feed language swept.
- `088001a`: the Windows fake-mode soak flake — ONE late legitimate
  convergence pass landed after the fixed 400ms `settled` sample on a loaded
  runner and read as self-feeding. Quiescence now measures from an observed
  plateau (deadline catches real self-feeds). 4 local runs green.

**The macOS Keychain question, answered from the field with one honest gap:**
live slot (our daily topology) — `~/.claude/.credentials.json` is STILL the
clauth symlink days into constant use, so the migrate-and-rewrite behavior
never fires for a refresh-less login (under a rotating pair CC demonstrably
replaces the symlink — `classify_link_at`'s content arm is the fossil), and
sessions ran across the Aug-2 07:50 re-stamp and weeks of chain cycles with
no sign-outs. Disclosed caveat: the fork also mirrors the unsuffixed Keychain
item on re-stamp, so survival alone can't prove the read path — the intact
symlink is the part the mirror can't explain. `clauth start` (namespaced
item): NO field data — our sessions don't use it. Written to the maintainer
as inference-not-observation; offered to instrument a long start-session.

**#51 UNBLOCKED (comment 2026-07-31 15:59):** "Start after #59 merges … cut
from `mommy`." Belt accepted (last-known-good copy on every well-formed read,
restore after two bad reads under RotationGuard); both one-liners accepted
(`launch_store: Some(profiles/<name>/auth.json)` at codex registration in
phase 3; stand-down scoped to profiles with a live codex session). Codex
series starts when #59 lands.

**ccsbar (0e128bc, deployed + pushed):** delete-account verb (context menu →
danger-tinted armed confirm naming every consequence → `clauth delete <name>
--yes`, CLI-only, never `--force`, stderr surfaced verbatim), inactive-plan
collapse (tier `canceled`/`free` folds into a "N inactive accounts"
disclosure; the ACTIVE account never collapses — mutation-verified), and the
`rolling_token` decode alias (new key falling back to `session_feed`) — the
"rename ccsbar's coding key in the same window as fork main" coordination
hazard is GONE. 222 tests / 0 failures.

**Fork-sync debts this round creates (for the next SYNC):** when fork main
reconciles to the merged #59 form — (a) fork machines' `config.toml` keys
migrate `session_feed` → `rolling_token` by re-running `clauth rolling-token
<p>` once per armed profile (the alias is gone); (b) delete the now-orphaned
`~/.clauth/profiles/*/session-token.kind` files; (c) ccsbar already reads
both keys, nothing to do there.

### UPS-11 addendum — ccsbar review round (4778b3c + 6cb51b2, both deployed)

A code-review pass over 0e128bc found 6 real defects; a verification re-run
confirmed 4 closed and narrowed 2, now also fixed:

1. stderr→reason took the LAST line, so clauth's two-line `resolve_or_bail`
   refusal rendered as a bare profile list with no error. Now
   `deleteFailureReason` (pure, fixture-tested) flattens the WHOLE refusal.
2. stderr drained only inside `terminationHandler` = unbounded-pipe deadlock,
   and `deleteInFlight` is a single global gate, so one wedged delete would
   disable the verb app-wide. Concurrent drain + 30s SIGTERM watchdog.
3. Delete had no mutual exclusion with `clauth login` (which runs OUTSIDE the
   state flock for its whole browser wait — a concurrent delete races the
   profile dir). Menu item + confirm guard + the banner's own Delete button
   all gate on loginInFlight now.
4. `pendingDeletePrompt` self-heals when its target vanishes (mirrors
   `ChainEdit.removalConsequence`); `commitRename` gained the same guard.
5. Inspection anchoring a collapsed row: both the EXPLICIT path (onChange on
   hiddenNames + the toggle action) and the FALLBACK path
   (`StatusModel.inspected` skips `planInactive && !active` rows; all-folded
   → no card). Pinned both directions.
6. The one inlined bug was in the one helper NOT extracted as pure — the
   extraction discipline is the test coverage, again.

229 tests / 0 failures. #59 CI: all six legs green on `088001a`.

## UPS-12 — #59 round 4: the reviewer's round 3 + the verification fleet catching my own round (2026-08-04)

**Head `deea209`, 9 commits on `mommy` (`edff4a8`).** His round 3 ("Round 4"
by his count) ACCEPTED the marker deletion — "went further than I asked and
the tree is better for it" — re-ran all five of our mutations himself, and
returned 2 blockers + 5 majors + ~20 smaller. Everything taken; reply
`issuecomment-5187215252`; PR body at nine commits.

**His two blockers:** (1) the dead-chain degrade could install an EXPIRED
preserved mint (`restored ||` short-circuited `sidecar_live`) — fixed at the
source: `live_backup_bytes` refuses non-live backups for every restore path
(heal included), the file stays as evidence, and the missing test arm asserts
Broken; (2) mommy moved again and its new `no_bare_print_macro_under_src`
guard reds our 10 `println!` sites — rebased, `outln!` everywhere.

**His majors:** `SidecarKind::Misfilled` third variant (a mis-fill carries
chain scopes and classified Rolling; status.json published the lie — his
"one that stings" on his own wiki-row contract); preserve's swallowed read
error could destroy the only mint copy (loud now, NotFound-only quiet); the
inline re-stamp leg could park the tick thread on the timeout-less
rotation.lock (`RotationGuard::try_acquire` + `LockWait::NoWait`, gate
answers `Cause::RotationLockHeld`); `static-token`'s four verdicts; the
false 2026-07 attribution in wiki/daemon.md cut; both MEASURED test-rigor
holes (outer scan gap, TUI rolling row — whose label also counted to the
wrong clock, off by the 2h horizon).

**The fleet round (the part to remember):** an adversarial 5-lens Workflow
over my own round-3 commit, verify-behind-find, CONFIRMED five regressions
in my fixes before push — the practice his reviews model, now applied to
ourselves pre-push:
1. His own "validate, arm, then persist" suggestion breaks the arm: the
   refresh leg stamps through the FLAG-GATED rotation hook, and `outln!`
   exit(0)-on-closed-reader at the report could leave armed-but-unflagged.
   Correct shape: persist BEFORE, roll back to PRIOR value on failed report.
2. My GrantUnusable pre-check dropped the WriteFailed arm's live-sidecar
   fallback → live-mint profiles became hard switch refusals.
3. The expired-backup refusal + bare `exists()` idempotence guard poisoned
   the slot permanently (the recovery my own error message prescribes
   destroyed the fresh mint). preserve now REPLACES non-live backups.
4. static-token's Mint no-op verdict ignored the clock; expired backups
   went unnamed in two verdicts.
5. The unreadable-sidecar test was vacuous (a dir fails the WRITE too) —
   pins the read arm's error context now.

**Tooling lessons, both mutation-related:** (a) `mv`-restored sources keep
pre-mutation mtimes and cargo keeps the MUTATED object — `touch` before
trusting any post-restore run (a false red burned 20 minutes); (b) a
string-anchored mutation can hit the WRONG occurrence of an identical line
(`sidecar_live` appears in two arms) — anchor mutations to the ARM, and
treat "mutation stayed green" as target-verification failure first.

1823 passed / 0 failed / 2 ignored, clippy `-D warnings`, fmt. All new pins
mutation-verified red. #51 still gated on #59 merging.

## UPS-13 — #59 round 5: his round 4 measured the CLI layer unpinned; the fleet caught the freshness hole (2026-08-07)

**Head `f0ca1be`, 11 commits on `mommy` (`edff4a8` — no move, no rebase).**
His round 4 (review 2026-08-05, after our round-4 reply) confirmed both prior
blockers closed, planted 34 mutations of his own — credential logic well
pinned (15/18 killed), CLI report/copy layer almost entirely unpinned (14/16
survived) — and returned 3 gates + 4 majors + ~14 smaller + ONE question he
wanted answered, not fixed. Everything taken across two commits (`7e30f59`
round-4 findings, `f0ca1be` fleet catches); reply
`issuecomment-5224210166`; PR body at eleven commits, counts both legs.

**His three gates:** (1) the mis-fill `Ok(false)` arm fell through to
`vanilla_install_gate`, whose acquire BLOCKS — my own expired-backup fix had
just WIDENED that arm, so round 3's `LockWait::NoWait` held everywhere
except the newest path. Fixed by making `heal_misfilled_sidecar` a
three-state `HealOutcome` (also his heal-log major: the bool's fold made the
log lie and sent raced-away repairs down the vanilla path); `NoLiveBackup` on
NoWait answers new `Cause::SidecarMisfilled`. (2) Four measured survivors
(flag rollback `= true`, static-token clock gate, both read-back bails →
print+Ok) — all pinned and re-measured as mutations. (3) An unparseable
`session-token.static.json` trapped static-token in a loop its own recovery
advice couldn't exit (flag-off first → parse error → re-mint takes the
no-backup branch → identical failure) — not-a-mint slot content is now
QUARANTINED under the profile, slot cleared, recovery converges (e2e pinned).

**His question (flag-off-before-restore in `cmd_static_token`): answered as
DELIBERATE** — flag-on means the daemon re-stamps over the very mint the
failure copy tells the operator to capture; comment at the persist site +
the bail copy owns causation ("this command is what stopped its
re-stamping", substring-pinned).

**The fleet round (5 lenses over my own round-4 commit, 21 agents, 16
findings, 14 survived refutation, deduped to 9 — five real):**
1. **The freshness half of the one-rule major, which NEITHER of us named:**
   preserve keeping any LIVE backup let a live-but-OLDER backup do exactly
   what the dead one used to — flag off, `login --setup-token` writes the
   sidecar alone, next roll destroys the fresh year mint while preserving
   the stale one. Slot rule now: live AND at least as fresh (missing expiry
   = unbounded); pinned in three directions.
2. Disposal shared too: preserve quarantines a displaced never-was-a-mint
   holder (matching live_backup_bytes); dead mints overwritten in place.
3. `restore_static_mint` was the ONE repair destroying mis-fill evidence
   silently — quarantines the pair before overwriting now.
4. My new expired-mint CLI verdict used zero grace beside the 5-minute rule
   the same commit argued for — both share `BACKUP_EXPIRY_GRACE_MS`, window
   itself pinned (his "zero the grace, suite stays green" probe now reds).
5. A restore that ERRORS bailed with the flag off and a raw fs error owning
   none of it — with_context copy owns the flip, pinned.

**Sweep-worthy specifics:** BACKUP_EXPIRY_GRACE_MS = 5min standing on CC's
own refresh threshold (AUTH_GATE_GRACE_MS's sibling gap left — inherited,
offered as follow-up); `Transient::permanent_until_relogin` →
`ROLLING_BROKEN_RETRY_MS` (asymmetry pinned: ordinary Endpoint transient
keeps the short cadence); Cause copy test states all NINE arms + the
permanence split; retry_after_ms sweeps departed names; `rolling_projection`
one constructor; SECURITY.md requested-vs-granted six-scope clause (his own
correction) + quarantine row covers the static.json class; wiki row says
refresh-token-first. `RotationLockUnavailable` KEEPS its semicolon — his
round-1 copy and its pin; the ` · ` sweep is round-new strings only.

**Count discipline (his catch):** `grep Summary | tail` returns the DEBUG
leg; rounds had drifted comparing release-vs-debug. From now on: both legs,
platform named. This round: 1837 debug / 1835 release, 0 failed, 2 ignored
(macOS), clippy `-D warnings`, fmt. 16/16 targeted mutations red across the
two rounds. Two-file shape: filed on HIS side, blocked on the codex harness
proving the file-membership resolver. #51 still gated on #59 merging.

## UPS-14 (2026-08-11) — #59 round 6: rebase onto 4c6c97c, --clear reconcile, the watching leash

**Trigger:** his round-6 review (2026-08-08, 4th→5th CHANGES_REQUESTED,
review 4888351018: three holds + a round-5 reachability mea culpa +
smaller) AND his 2026-08-11 comment: mommy moved to 4c6c97c (23 commits),
last four in our namespace — upstream shipped `static-token --clear`
(required=true, bare form RESERVED for our restore) + which::SessionTokenMatch,
and left two design questions to our two-file shape.

**Shipped (head 8330fa1, 14 commits on 4c6c97c, force-pushed; reply
issuecomment-5253252430; PR body at fourteen commits):**

- REBASE onto 4c6c97c: 11 commits replayed (rerere; conflicts at 4 commits;
  cli.rs AUTO-MERGED into TWO StaticToken variants — the trap: git showed no
  marker), README rolling prose → wiki (Quickstart/Configuration), FEATURE_MAP
  re-bucketed Switch+Headless, ·rolling tag dropped per upstream 5dde024,
  session_tokens cache collapsed back to plain SessionTokenStatus.
- --CLEAR = FULL EXIT (both his questions answered YES, one principle):
  flag first, then sidecar, then preserved mint — CLI + TUI. Widened
  nothing-to-clear (all three pieces), other-login guard covers the backup
  slot, backup DELETED not quarantined (operator-confirmed removal ≠
  evidence), mis-filled sidecar QUARANTINED first (fleet catch).
- Hold 1: every 6h hold records credential_fingerprint (mtime+len of the
  three files), any change releases next scan; two false re-login comments
  rewritten; his not-an-ask TAKEN: rolling_sidecar_restamp_due reads
  NotLongLived due NOW → daemon-side heal reachable.
- Hold 2: AUTH_GATE_GRACE_MS = BACKUP_EXPIRY_GRACE_MS (one home) — PLUS the
  fleet found the SIXTH consumer neither of us listed: vanilla_install_gate's
  static arm had zero grace (static-token EXPIRED vs switch installs same
  bytes — his exact scenario, one gate over). Pinned both directions.
- Hold 3: scope_widening_disclosure/restamp_promise/rollback_stranded_warning
  + the clear's three lines = single-caller fns (deleted print = dead_code
  under -D warnings, HIS verification method) + content pins.
- StateLockBusy: sidecar_repair_transient downcasts StateLockTimeout in the
  chain (macOS flock across 20s security shell-out = contention, never
  "check permissions"). TEN cause arms stated.
- FLEET (57 agents, 22 confirmed of 26): THE CRITICAL — clear/restore flag
  persist wrote the pre-acquire config snapshot back through save_profile
  (persists WHOLE profile) → a rotation landing during the UNBOUNDED confirm
  prompt rewound to a spent refresh token. Fix: load_profile from disk UNDER
  the guard, write only the flag; `active` re-read under guard too (dangling
  symlink both directions). TUI clear: RotationGuard::try_acquire (loud toast
  on held), row offered on ANY long-lived piece, hint discloses full scope.
- ecf7db2 (upstream) fails clippy 1.96 nonminimal_bool → is_none_or rewrite
  in our series (flagged in reply, his to keep or cherry-pick).

**Verification:** 1881 debug / 1879 release, 0 failed, 2 ignored (macOS),
clippy -D warnings + fmt clean. 23/23 targeted mutations red across two
sweeps (17 + 6, incl. his five measured survivors). CI watcher pending at
ledger time.

**Learned:** (1) A rebase can auto-merge two same-named clap variants with
NO conflict marker — grep the enum after every rebase. (2) save_profile
persists the whole profile: NEVER write a pre-prompt/pre-guard config
snapshot back — load under the guard, mutate one field. (3) The fleet's
worktree must be a git worktree pinned at HEAD (mutation driver runs
concurrently in the main tree).

**Next:** his round-7 re-measure. #51 codex series still gated on #59
merging. AUTH_GATE sibling gap CLOSED this round (the 6th consumer), so the
old offered follow-up is moot.

## UPS-15 — #59 round 7 (2026-08-13)

**Shipped:** head `7368560`, 16 commits REBASED onto mommy `043c813`
(upstream +51: api-key clear copy 1103ec2, trimmed action menu, keychain
budget work, alibaba console). Reply issuecomment-5278735531; PR body at
sixteen commits.

**His round-7 review (4921878688):** one ask (--yes destroys the preserved
mint silently) + seven measured items + rebase instruction ("leave that
copy to me") + a claim he could not repro (clippy 1.96 nonminimal_bool) +
wiki field-data request.

**Round-7 commit (findings):** clear_backup_postscript unconditional on the
removal (CLI) + " · the preserved mint is gone" toast suffix (TUI), content
pins for all four clear copy fns, TUI flag persisted-then-flipped, one
refusal condition on both surfaces (flag-only disarms; was visible-row-
silent-return), other-login refusal re-checked under the guard (threaded
race test, "anymore" discriminator, retry-until-won), has_static_backup
one spelling at the clear site, retry_hold takes HoldKind (duration+watch
derive from kind).

**Rebase resolutions:** his TUI strings byte-identical (his pins pass
unmodified); CLI weave was git-clean (his confirm/post-clear branching
around our three-piece); ActionMenuAction::ClearSessionToken + menu test
DROPPED (upstream removed the whole row-proxy layer); keychain_write →
keychain_mirror_rotation at claude_feed_tick's active mirror (his call to
verify); 248d41f == his 3ca1663 (comment contributed); one replay dropped
his logline import from claude.rs (marker-free auto-merge — caught by
building every commit's tree); wiki merges keep his AuthExpired/api-key
rows + our rolling rows.

**Fleet (51 agents, 23 raw → 18 upheld / 5 refuted), second commit:**
- CRITICAL PAIR: arm_rolling_from_disk + rolling_install_gate never
  re-checked the FLAG under the guard → a parked writer re-stamps a fresh
  rolling bearer over a COMPLETED clear (flag off = nothing re-stamps it,
  backup already gone). Both re-read disk under guard now; Block leg drops
  guard → vanilla, NoWait leg → Ready.
- TUI other-login gate read a snapshot reload_fingerprint can never
  invalidate (doesn't stat credentials.json) → disk re-check under guard.
  `active` stays in-memory deliberately (TUI is the switcher; his tests pin it).
- Relink now lands BEFORE backup removal on both surfaces (dangling live
  slot under "clear failed" otherwise); partial state owned in words.
- detail_row was a THIRD gate reader still dimming on the old condition →
  Snap::clear_gated, one spelling; flag-only-no-login gets its own copy on
  hint/toast/CLI (was promising an api key that doesn't exist).

**Clippy claim resolution:** BOTH real — local stable 1.96.0 reds the
isolated repro under -D warnings; his 1.97.1 passes (lint narrowed).
Wiki field data: the plan-gated model tier is Fable (claude-fable-5); no
captured response body (incident predates the feature).

**Verification:** 2028 debug / 2026 release, 0 failed, 3 ignored (macOS),
clippy -D warnings + fmt clean. 20/20 targeted mutations red across two
sweeps (10 + 10; N10 needed the persist-failure injection moved from
config.toml-as-dir to read-only-dir after the fleet fix relocated the
first fallible read). CI watcher pending at ledger time.

**Learned:** (1) zsh eats `$c:src/...` as a history modifier — quote
`${c}:path` in loops or the data is garbage. (2) A fleet fix can MOVE the
first fallible step above a mutation's target, silently degrading an
existing kill — re-run the prior sweep's neighbors after restructuring.
(3) rerere can resurrect a stale resolution mid-autosquash; disable it
before surgical rebases. (4) Upstream deleting a host mechanism (menu
row-proxy layer) means our plug-in variant dies with it — follow the
rework, don't re-introduce the layer.

**Next:** his round-8 re-measure (two veto handles left open: menu entry
for the clear row, keychain_mirror_rotation choice; plus the bare-restore
backup spelling offered as next-round work). #51 codex series still gated
on #59 merging.

## UPS-16 — #59 MERGED (2026-08-13)

Upstream merged `feat/session-token-feed` as TRUE MERGE `7340d44` — second
parent is our exact head `7368560`, sixteen commits kept as reviewed. His
gate on the merged tree (linux, isolated target): 2103 debug / 2101
release, 0 failed; clippy -D warnings, fmt, deny, audit clean. Post-merge
comment: issuecomment-5282390909; our ack: issuecomment-5284558847.

- **Merge-side collision fix (his):** mommy had grown 8 herdr commits; the
  only real break was herdr's zsh `'"'"'` apostrophe idiom (correct zsh,
  odd quote count) vs our completions single-quote-parity scan. Each
  branch green alone; no CI leg on either side ever ran the pair. His fix:
  idiom elided before counting behind a shared `zsh_quote_parity_holds`;
  a bare apostrophe in the rolling-token spec still reds both backstops.
- **All three follow-ups owned upstream — nothing owed by us:**
  - `aed141b` (landed): TUI clear row reads `active` OFF DISK — his
    override of our deliberate in-memory read; the argument that settles
    it is `daemon/tick.rs:226` + `fallback.rs:1628` calling
    `switch_profile` with no keypress in this process, so the snapshot
    goes stale with no user action and the relink lands on the wrong
    profile or leaves the live slot dangling. Plus em-dash → `·` sweep
    and the backup-failure message keeping the completed relink/disarm.
  - `c33204a` (landed): Quickstart names the third clear outcome.
  - PENDING his side: `keychain_mirror_rotation` foreign-login hole — the
    ONE finding he rates seriously. Both mirror writes (`oauth.rs:1315`
    sidecar-fill, `:2145` rolling tick) sit where `live_login_is_foreign`
    (:1286) can never run, so the only guard is `cfg.is_active` — clauth's
    belief about the file layer, not a read of the item. Failure shape:
    A rolling+active, operator `/login`s as B in a session, CC writes B
    into the item; next re-stamp lands A's bearer while `Keep::Everything`
    preserves B's organizationUuid/trustedDeviceToken → mixed-identity
    item that never self-corrects. CONFIRMED by us on the merged tree
    (ack has the line numbers). The same-account assumption was our pick
    in round 7 (keychain_write's replacement); he fixes it upstream.
- **Round-7 decisions ratified:** menu-variant drop = right, no veto.
  Clippy dispute settled as 1.96→1.97 lint narrowing (both measurements
  real; rewrite kept, costs nothing). Fable wiki detail recorded as
  relayed-not-measured. `cmd_static_token` hand-built backup path moved
  to HIS books (consolidation = bail→silent-false on restore, his call).

**Learned:** (1) A completions-parity test can be broken by a sibling
branch's legal-but-odd shell idiom — quote-counting scans need the idiom
table, not just the balance. (2) "Same-account by construction" is a
claim about MY writer, not about the item: any shared-store mirror must
re-check whose login it is overwriting (live_login_is_foreign) — file-
layer belief (`is_active`) is not that check.

**Next:** #51 codex series UNBLOCKED — cut from `mommy` (now `c33204a`),
against upstream's `docs/codex-plan.md`, 6-part series, belt + both
one-liners accepted. OWED at next fork SYNC: true-merge the merged mommy
(incl. herdr + his follow-ups), reconcile CLA-FEED to merged form, then
the standing debts — re-run `clauth rolling-token <p>` per armed profile,
delete orphaned session-token.kind files.

## CXH — codex harness series (#51), phases 1-4 (2026-08-17/18)

Branch `feat/codex-harness`, cut from mommy `98958aa` (post-#59-merge). Spec:
upstream `docs/codex-plan.md`. NOT pushed yet (whole series lands together or
per-phase per maintainer's delivery pref — decide at PR time). Local head after
phase 4: `135e3dd`.

Per-phase, each sealed with impl → adversarial fleet (opus, find→2 refuters) →
targeted mutations → both test legs:

- **P1 harness axis** (2f0ec60..06a3cc0, 7 commits): Harness enum,
  codex-profiles.toml (CodexState, private slots, update() = load-mutate-save
  under one lock), cross-file name uniqueness (reads both rosters), reload
  fingerprint stat, live-row harness tag, which codex arm (claude-runtime-claim
  outranks inherited CODEX_HOME; shaped-home fails closed), folded fixes 2/4/5,
  switch/delete dispatch off bare name. Fleet 72 agents, 15/15 mutations, 2347/0.
- **P2 seam** (3384752): HarnessEngine trait, ClaudeEngine delegation; start /
  mcp-delegate / switch_profile bound through it. ensure_installable NOT seamed
  (claude-shaped AUTH-1 gate). Behavior-preserving.
- **P3 runtime+capture** (013c075/cead056/3c04194/edb75f6/17a9151): per-session
  codex-home-<sid> (auth.json ONE physical file symlinked; config copied;
  operator surfaces linked; hooks opt-in; durable sqlite+wal/shm+history linked;
  sessions synced back at teardown); start dispatch (forced -c store=file,
  cross-harness env scrub, --with-fallback/--rescue refuse); `login --codex` =
  ADOPT (operator auth.json → symlink into profile store; one carrier, decision
  8; copy+warn on no-symlink hosts); GC of dead codex homes; fake-mode auth
  converge both ways; identity-guarded re-auth. Two fleet rounds (120+ agents),
  16/16 mutations.
- **P4 refresh** (7308fd5/2a6b178/143e071/135e3dd): codex_auth = auth model
  (read-modify-write, key-preserving) + refresh classification (reused=permanent)
  + standby pass (DURABLE no-replay memo survives restart; kick w/ 2-breaker
  consumed only at wire; stand-down scoped to live carrier, fake-mode=always;
  belt gated on 30s bad-read + no live session; unreadable-exp → last_refresh
  fallback) wired into the SCHEDULER tick (fetch-lease holder, NOT the daemon
  watchdog tick — the fleet's critical catch). codex_login = PKCE browser flow
  reimplemented (wire facts vs openai/codex rust-v0.145.0: ports 1455/1457,
  form-vs-JSON encoding, nested account_id claim, best-effort api-key exchange).
  Fleet 98 agents (16 upheld all fixed), 15/16 mutations (P11 scheduler-wire =
  accepted gap, needs full-tick harness).

STANDING PRACTICE reinforced: adversarial fleet on a git-worktree pinned at HEAD;
mutation driver uses `git checkout --` so COMMIT BEFORE MUTATING (wiped an
uncommitted batch once, recovered by replay); seal on the FULL suite not a name
filter (a grammar-drift + a GC-neutrality test only fire there); fmt reflows
multi-line anchors (re-read before re-mutating).

## CXH-2 — the isolation-escape sweep, and the rebase onto current mommy (2026-08-23)

Six more commits on `feat/codex-harness`, then the whole 25-commit series
rebased onto mommy `eb6cbb8`.

The round started from ONE finding — codex resolves its sqlite state DBs
through `sqlite_home`, which is a config KEY as well as `CODEX_SQLITE_HOME`,
and our session config.toml is a verbatim copy of the operator's, so every
profile's goals/logs/memories/state could land in one directory with the home's
durable links never opened through. Generalizing that defect class over the
whole codex surface (6-lens adversarial workflow, 66 agents, 20 raw → 18
upheld) found the rest:

- the env CREDENTIALS that outrank the linked auth.json. codex's own `load_auth`
  resolves CODEX_API_KEY → ephemeral → CODEX_ACCESS_TOKEN → then the persistent
  store, its comment reading "API key via env var takes precedence over any
  other auth method". We scrubbed OPENAI_API_KEY for that exact reason and had
  missed its two siblings, so `clauth start <p>` could spend a different account
  than it named. Three endpoint overrides joined them.
- the copied config is SANITIZED now, not merely overridden: `debug.config_lockfile.load_path`
  makes codex rebuild from `ConfigLayerStack::new(vec![lock_layer], ..)`, which
  ERASES the `-c` layer rather than losing to it — taking decision 6's store pin
  with it.
- the acquire-side stale-home wipe demands a session id (Fake names are all
  sid-free, so the isolated home — a physical auth.json COPY — was being deleted
  after a crash and the SPENT store token converged back out).
- `gc_codex_homes` takes the state lock; its "the acquire flocks the marker
  before the home exists" comment was false, so the whole build window read as
  dead and starting sessions were reaped.
- the capture refusal stopped prescribing chain destruction: codex login goes
  through `logout_with_revoke`, which reads through the adopted symlink and
  POSTs the refresh token to the revoke endpoint before minting.
- inventory: archived_sessions/ joins the sync-back (archiving was deleting at
  teardown), `<name>.config.toml` profile-v2 layers are copied+sanitized,
  plugins/ is linked, the durable store heals from codex's own corrupt-DB
  recovery, Fake refuses a second FLAVOR of one profile, and the dual-claim skip
  is claude-first like every other site.

Six design items that touch the maintainer's pinned decisions went upstream
instead (#51 issuecomment-5471926707), two of them unfixable locally: MDM /
`/etc/codex/managed_config.toml` outranks `-c` (SessionFlags 30 vs 40/50), and
the write-only `sessions/` sync-back whose fix contradicts his runtime table.

23/23 targeted mutations killed. Post-rebase 2798 passed / 0 failed, and
`git rebase --exec 'cargo check'` verified every one of the 25 commits builds.

REBASE NOTES for next time: the 169-commit gap cost a `ProfileName` newtype
migration across every codex call site, a `&StateLockHeld` witness parameter on
`with_state_lock`, the deletion of `--rescue`/`--no-rescue`, a
`__CLATHA_LOGIN_FLAGS__` completions template fed by `cli::LOGIN_FLAGS`, and a
`testutil::live_row` fixture builder. Two gotchas worth carrying: a mechanical
"union" conflict resolution stitches two function bodies together whenever the
closing brace sits in the SHARED context after the marker (compile-check
immediately after every union), and adapting only at the tip means a second
pass — each adaptation has to move back to the commit that first needs it, or
the series does not build commit-by-commit.

## CXH-3 — phases 5 and 6: the series is complete (2026-08-23)

`948bd39` / `c8ce233` / `0790896`, 28 commits on mommy `eb6cbb8`.

**P5, the usage leg.** `wham/usage` is DURATION-keyed, never name-keyed — it
says "a window of N seconds is P percent spent", never "this is the weekly
one" — so `src/usage/codex.rs` is where a duration becomes one of clauth's two
named slots. Over a day is weekly, under it is 5h, position breaks a tie, and
two windows naming one slot do not overwrite each other (the second takes the
free slot, because dropping it loses the tighter of two real limits).
`limit_reached` is a HARD verdict outranking the percentages it came with, lands
on the fuller window, and is never fabricated onto one the body omitted.
`plan_type` gets its own `PlanInfo.codex_plan` rather than a `PlanTier`, whose
every label spells "Claude <tier>". Banked reset credits ride the same response.

Readings land in the SHARED `UsageStore` keyed by name — safe by construction,
not convention: names are globally unique across both state files, and the
claude walk only ever indexes its own members. The chain comes from
`codex-profiles.toml` alone with `check_scoped` disarmed, and a switch moves the
codex active slot to land at the NEXT session, because codex binds auth.json at
start. Folded fix 1 is answered by filling the freshness pass for codex instead
of changing a shared predicate, keeping claude behavior-preserving.

**P6, the published surface.** Four additive top-level fields and a per-entry
`harness`, schema still 1; the existing `active_profile`/`wrap_off` stay the
claude slots and codex entries are appended, so a reader that predates codex
takes exactly the prefix it always took. `clauth_version` is what lets a reader
tell an old daemon from a new one with an empty codex roster. The TUI gains a
read-only codex section and a `c` harness filter — read-only because the cursor
and every action are bound to `config.profiles`, and a filter that could hide
the selected row is a footgun. Copy fixed in four places that had quietly
claimed clauth manages only Claude Code.

**The bug a test caught, worth remembering:** `write_profile_cache` gated on
`is_configured`, which reads `profiles.toml` alone by design. Every codex usage
reading was therefore dropped silently — the fetch succeeded, the in-memory
store filled, and the by-name cache the feed and the Overview resolve stayed
empty forever. The gate means "is this still an account", and a codex profile is
one; it just lives in the other roster.

2815 passed / 0 failed, 15/15 targeted mutations killed.

**PR OPEN 2026-08-31: https://github.com/uwuclxdy/clauth/pull/69** (28 commits on
mommy eb6cbb8, MERGEABLE; #51 stays the design thread). Awaiting the
maintainer on the two parked design items (#51 issuecomment-5471926707): the
managed-config layer that outranks `-c`, and the write-only `sessions/`
sync-back whose fix contradicts the runtime table.

**WHAM-1 2026-09-02 (fork main f6744ba, deployed):** the live `wham/usage`
verdict became an object (`{"type":"rate_limit_reached",…}`), sent only once
an account is blocked — fork main's string-only parser failed every poll of a
limited account. Fixed (untagged string|object), `rate_limit_reset_credits.
available_count` carried through as status.json `codex_reset_credits`. The PR
branch already parses the object shape; it does not publish the count (spec
never named it) — fork-sync keeps main's publish.

**SUPERSEDED — the P5/P6 checklist above shipped. Original scope note:** (wham/usage → named 5h/7d slots, chain member,
disarm check_scoped for codex, fold fix 1, wire kick_codex to the 401 arm — the
last #[allow(dead_code)]) and **P6 published surface** (status.json/which
--json/list_profiles additive codex fields, TUI c-codex/c-claude filter + header
chip, daemon-version warning, MCP/plugin/tokens copy fixes). Then fleet+mutate
each, PR to uwuclxdy/clauth per delivery series.

## UPS-17 — the big sync: fork main ← upstream/mommy v0.15.1+ (2026-09-09)

**Why now.** Fork main's last true merge was UPS-6 (v0.13.0+v0.13.1, 2026-07-23).
Upstream had moved 646 commits past the merge-base `8c0840cf` — four releases
(v0.14.0, v0.14.1, v0.15.0, v0.15.1) plus eight days of post-release fixes,
head `435a859f`. AX's call: catch up, and **where upstream already did the same
thing (and did it better), take upstream's** — divergence-reduction over
preservation.

**Shape of the merge.** 56 conflicted files / ~320 hunks: 27 src, 25 test files,
README + SECURITY + .gitignore, and `wiki/daemon.md` (a case-only rename to
`wiki/Daemon.md` upstream, then rewritten — the fork's 4-line pointer paragraph
re-added under its Field notes). The dangerous part was NOT the markers: three
upstream refactors changed the signature of nearly every helper the fork's 17
fork-only modules call, so those files compile against nothing even though git
reports them clean —

  * `ProfileName` newtype for every profile name that flows anywhere;
  * `with_state_lock(|held| …)` handing the closure a `&StateLockHeld` witness,
    with `set_active(.., held)` / `set_credentials(.., held)` / `remove(.., held)`
    taking it — the fork's `update_app_state(|s|)` survives as `|s, held|`;
  * `TokenFailure` replacing the anyhow token errors, and deliberately carrying
    NO `Display`, so every log site renders `log_detail()` / `text_with_status()`.

**What was DROPPED as superseded** (upstream's form adopted wholesale):
CLA-FEED in its entirety → upstream's merged rolling-token (our own PR #59 after
seven review rounds of race fixes the fork's copy never got); the fork's
Keychain-first relink ordering → `publish_credential_link` +
`keychain_mirror_source(Leave|SignOut)`; `auto_rescue` / `--rescue` (upstream
deleted the flag — isolated sessions always keep transcripts); `CaptureIdentity`
→ `CaptureSnapshot { account_uuid: Option<AccountId>, account_email, live_login }`;
`first_refusal_of` → upstream's on-disk `ADOPT_REFUSAL_FILE` memo;
`drop_cache_file` → `remove_profile_cache`; the fork's TUI-side usage-history
appender (upstream's scheduler owns `usage_history.jsonl` now); the fork's
`route` column on the Overview → upstream's `live` column; the fork's
`ACTIVE_ROTATE_LEAD_FLOOR_MS` → upstream's identical `ROTATE_LEAD_FLOOR_MS`;
`proactive_rotation_due`'s five-flag fork signature → upstream's two.

**What SURVIVED** (fork-only, retyped onto the new APIs): the whole codex engine
(harness axis, `src/codex/*`, isolated CODEX_HOME runtime + watchdog, standby
refresh, codex chain + walk, CDX-6 `wham/usage` poll, `codex_reset_credits`),
`src/proxy/*` and `clauth proxy`, the daemon control socket, `clauth doctor`,
`tokens.json`, `fallback_config`, the per-harness `VecDeque<PendingSwitchEntry>`
switch queue with `Origin` precedence, SCW/RLS scheduler hardening, RESCUE-1/2c,
the identity anchor's email half + CAP-1/CAP-3, `atomic_write_600_fast` (the
non-durable 1/s `status.json` write) now built on upstream's per-writer
`tmp_sibling` staging, the fork's `--new`/`--codex`/`--browser` login flags, and
the status.json fork fields — now carried as typed members of upstream's
`ProfileEntry` (`harness`, `account_email`, `codex_snapshot_at`,
`codex_rate_limit_reached`, `codex_reset_credits`) rather than a hand-rolled
`json!` literal.

**Wire contract for the GUI clients** (ccsbar, Pulse): every key those two read
still ships. The one rename is `session_feed` → `rolling_token`, which both
readers already handle (ccsbar `0e128bc`, Pulse `ClauthStatus.swift`), and
`ProfileConfig::rolling_token` carries `#[serde(alias = "session_feed")]` so a
profile this fork armed under the old key stays armed across the upgrade.
New additive keys upstream brought: per-profile `auto_start_queue`.
`docs/ccsbar/DESIGN.md` documents both.

**Verification so far:** `cargo check` clean, zero warnings, on the merged tree.
Test files were resolved in parallel by four agents against a written
resolution brief (`scratchpad/ups/RESOLUTION-BRIEF.md`); `cargo test` +
`clippy` + `fmt` still owed, then deploy.

### UPS-17 verification — the 18 failures, and what each one meant

First full run after the merge: **3288 passed / 18 failed**. None was cosmetic;
the triage is the interesting part, because three classes needed a decision
rather than a fix.

**A real merge bug the fork's own tests caught.**
`snapshot_active_credentials` lost its divergence guard: I kept the fork's body
shape (read live → check the store path → capture) and dropped the
`LinkState::Diverged` gate with it, so the unattended snapshot would have
captured a FOREIGN live login into the active profile's store — the exact
2026-07-12 incident shape (a running claude mirrored a sibling's rotated pair;
the capture copied it into the wrong account, and the two then double-polled
one account into a rate-limit pin). Fixed by taking upstream's body verbatim,
which guards it structurally: `Diverged` returns, and the only thing a diverged
slot may still do is complete a FIRST login through `adopt_first_login`.

**A behaviour the fork had to keep, restored.** Upstream's `known_paths` walks
the runtime dirs that exist, which dropped the fork's codex gate from settings
sync. Restored as a `retain` in `settings_sync.rs` (the fork's own file), and
its test now creates both profiles' `runtime/` dirs so the assertion can fail
for the right reason — as written it would have passed on a config-only fixture
either way.

**Fixtures that upstream's new rules made dishonest.** `write_profile_cache`
now skips any name `profiles.toml` does not carry, so six fork tests were
asserting against caches that were never written; they register their rosters
now (`testutil::register_names`, or `save_app_state` in the fixture helper).
Three TUI render tests reached the operator's real `~/.clauth` through the
fork's email column and are sandboxed. Two daemon tests now disarm upstream's
plugin/herdr self-heal the way upstream's own tick tests do.

**Two deliberate divergences, written down rather than papered over.**
- `the_pre_rename_session_feed_key_is_not_carried` is upstream's test asserting
  that no `session_feed` alias exists. This fork is the one install where that
  key DID ship — armed profiles on this machine still carry it — so the alias
  stays and the test now pins the fork's rule and says why. Dropping the key
  silently would disarm the split, and the operator would learn about it from a
  Fable refusal rather than from clauth.
- `reauth_of_the_active_account_force_relinks_the_stale_mirror` drove
  `capture_into_profile`, which upstream narrowed to the new-profile path; the
  was-active force-relink it protects now lives in `overwrite_captured_profile`
  (where `LoginRoute::Reauth` lands). The test was re-pointed at that door, not
  weakened.

Also real: the fork's `println!` in `main.rs`/`proxy`/`doctor` violated
upstream's `outln!` rule (which exists so `clauth sessions | head` cannot panic
on a closed stdout) — 28 converted; and the fork's `fallback`/`proxy`/`doctor`
verbs plus upstream's `status`/`completions` were missing from the shell
completion scripts.

**Final gate:** `cargo test` **3306 passed / 0 failed / 3 ignored** (352s),
`cargo fmt --check` clean, `cargo clippy --all-targets` down to ONE warning —
`src/tui/render/footer.rs:317`, byte-identical to upstream's own code, where
this machine's clippy 1.96 is stricter than upstream's CI (the same red UPS-15
recorded and declined to fix).

### UPS-17 deployed (2026-09-09)

`~/.cargo/bin/clauth` swapped to **0.15.1** on a fresh inode (rm + cp — a
same-inode overwrite gets the running LaunchAgent SIGKILLed), both LaunchAgents
reloaded, daemon and proxy up. Rollback binary at
`scratchpad/ups/clauth-0.13.1-rollback`, pre-swap `profiles.toml` beside it.

Post-deploy verification, all read-only:

- `status.json` regenerates on schema 1, `clauth_version` 0.15.1, and carries
  every fork key the two GUI clients read — `forecast`, `burn_aware`,
  `weekly_switch_threshold`, `last_error`, `last_switch`,
  `active_codex_profile`, `codex_fallback_chain`, plus per-profile `harness`,
  `account_email`, `codex_snapshot_at`, `codex_rate_limit_reached`,
  `codex_reset_credits` — with upstream's `rolling_token` and
  `auto_start_queue` alongside.
- **The `session_feed` alias did its job**: the three claude profiles still
  carry `session_feed = true` on disk, and `ax-main` publishes
  `rolling_token: true` — i.e. its sidecar still holds a rolling bearer and the
  split stayed engaged across the upgrade. The key normalizes to
  `rolling_token` on the next config rewrite.
- `auth_broken` is byte-identical before and after (`ax-cl`, `ax-backup` —
  both already quarantined; the upgrade touched no login).
- Codex polling live again on the new build: `ax-codex-xfx` 85% weekly with 1
  banked reset, `ax-codex-dev0` at 100%.

ccsbar and Pulse rebuilt and installed against it (`/Applications/ccsbar.app`,
`/Applications/Pulse.app` 1.0.9, its auto-update preference still 0).

### UPS-17 client follow-through (2026-09-09)

Both GUI clients caught up and reinstalled; neither needed a daemon change.

**Pulse `a26b229`** — it had been emitting `clauth feed <p> on|off` ever since
the #59 review renamed that verb to `rolling-token` / `static-token`, so its
rolling-token switch exited 2 and the account never armed. It survived a whole
sync with a green suite because a test asserted the literal dead argv: a test
that pins what the code emits, without ever asking whether anything accepts it,
can only confirm the bug. Found by auditing the deployed daemon. Pulse now
probes every verb it can emit against the installed `clauth <verb> --help`.
**Any client of this CLI needs that gate** — a rename here is silent on the
other side of the socket.

**ccsbar `cc8ee91`** — the menu-bar label is the whole fleet now, one brand
glyph and one pool figure per harness, where the figure is the mean over
countable accounts of the **weekly** window. It was `max(5h, 7d)`, which in
practice meant the 5h one, and AX watched the label swing 95 → 5 over a lunch
break. The week is also the only window codex publishes, so both harnesses read
on one axis. Four panel toggles: active-account-instead-of-pool,
remaining-instead-of-used, bars, and show-disarmed-mark. Panel type and geometry
scaled up; the whole label is composited into one `NSImage` because
`MenuBarExtra` drops sibling views.

**Open, not started — codex auto-switch is hard to arm and silent about it.**
AX's words: 「codex auto switch is kinda not straightforward」. Upstream has not
solved this — `upstream/mommy` carries no codex code at all, issue #45 is open
with the maintainer declining it, and `docs/codex-plan.md` is a spec handed to
us. So it is ours. Three concrete items, in the order they would pay off:

1. `snapshot_codex_chain` (`src/fallback.rs:1729`) returns `None` unless the
   active codex profile is already a chain member, and nothing anywhere says
   so — a codex profile outside the chain gets no `fallback` block at all
   (`src/daemon/status_json.rs`, the `position()?` early-return), so `armed` is
   absent rather than `false`. `doctor`'s `check_codex` has no chain check.
2. **The proxy already auto-arms and the daemon does not.** `pool_snapshot`
   (`src/proxy/mod.rs`) falls back to every codex profile with a stored login
   when the chain is empty; the daemon walk refuses instead. Teaching the walk
   the proxy's rule would delete the manual chain setup outright.
3. The TUI cannot edit the codex chain — its candidate picker filters codex
   profiles out (`src/tui/app.rs`), logged as deliberate debt. CLI or socket
   only, and `wiki/Auto-Switch.md` never says the word codex.

### UPS-18 — sync onto upstream's own codex engine (2026-09-16, IN FLIGHT)

**Upstream merged #69.** The six-part codex harness series landed on `mommy` as
`543f6260` on 2026-09-16 — 35 commits, after the 2026-09-01 CHANGES_REQUESTED
round. The codex engine we had been carrying as a fork-only subsystem is now
upstream's, in its reviewed form, so this sync **retires ours for it**: fork-only
subsystems survive a sync (SYNC.md principle 2) only while upstream has no
answer, and upstream now has ours.

Four other PRs merged in the same stretch — #70 (typed MiniMax provider, and
provider windows driving the chain), #71 (manual no-browser login for ssh
hosts), #73 (pick the account at session start by the models the session will
run). Open from other contributors: #77 (home account by weekday), #80 (stamp
`rateLimitTier` from the `/profile` probe so plan-gated flags see the seat), and
issues #79 (5h window stays pinned after a server-side reset — `preserve_live_window`
holds `prev` until the stale `resets_at` lapses), #78 (Team-plan sessions on a
clauth-minted login hit Claude Code's Fable-credit gate; a captured
`claude auth login` does not), #68 (Windows Modern Standby aborts the daemon).

Branch `sync/upstream-2026-09-16`, checkpoint `d8051b81`, 198 files,
+62,224/−14,000 against `3ea0aaf0`. **Not merged, not deployed.**

#### The migration, not just the merge

Upstream's split is the whole point: **a profile's harness is which state file
holds it** — `profiles.toml` for claude, `codex-profiles.toml` for codex — never
a field inside one. Dirs stay bare `profiles/<name>/`; the codex credential is
`profiles/<name>/auth.json` (the fork wrote `codex-auth.json`) with
`auth.attempt` / `auth.quarantine.json` / `auth.lkg.json` sidecars.
`CodexState::update` is the one mutation path: load under the state lock, mutate,
save if dirty — `&mut self` exists nowhere else.

- **The harness axis left `profiles.toml`.** Deleted: `Profile.harness`,
  `Profile::is_codex()`, `ProfileConfig.harness`, `AppState.active_codex_profile`,
  `AppState.codex_fallback_chain`, `AppConfig::is_active_codex`, their
  remove/rename maintenance, and the `harness` key in `config.toml`. That took
  seven guards out **structurally** rather than leaving them unreachable — the
  switch backstop, the endpoint-edit refusal, the capture-writer check, the
  stray-member walk filter and both fetch-leg filters can no longer be violated,
  because the wrong-harness value has nowhere to live.
- **The proxy is retargeted** (`src/proxy/mod.rs`). It no longer opens
  `profiles.toml` at all: roster, chain, weekly line, quarantine and store come
  from `CodexState`. Its live-owner special case went with the engine that needed
  it — `~/.codex/auth.json` is a symlink onto the active profile's store, so
  reading the store *is* reading the live file, and `account_identity` is now just
  `codex_auth::read_store_auth(account)`. `ensure_fresh_parked` delegates to
  upstream's `standby_pass`, which decides due-ness **under** the guard, stricter
  than the pre-gate the fork ran outside it. Window classification now keys on
  `minutes >= DAY_MINUTES` instead of primary/secondary naming.
- **The proxy standdown survived and changed jobs.** It used to suppress the
  fork's passive leg; it now gates upstream's active poll
  (`src/usage/scheduler.rs`, `if crate::proxy::proxy_active(interval_ms) { return; }`).
  While the proxy serves, every relayed request already writes that account's
  usage cache from its own `x-codex-*` headers, so polling `wham/usage` too would
  read the same fact twice at twice the traffic.
- **Codex chain editing is new code.** Upstream reaches its codex chain
  read-only, because upstream's only editor is a hand-edit — but ccsbar edits both
  chains over the socket. `CodexState` gained `fallback_chain_mut`,
  `set_switch_off_when_spent`, `set_weekly_switch_threshold`; `fallback_config.rs`
  replaced `chain_of`/`chain_of_mut` with `codex_member(name)` +
  `refuse_codex_member_knob(name, knob)`. Per-member knobs (threshold,
  last-resort, weekly, usage gate) now **refuse on a codex member, with a reason**:
  upstream's codex walk hands every member `DEFAULT_THRESHOLD` and the chain-wide
  weekly line, so a stored per-member number would be read by nothing. Client
  follow-up: **ccsbar should stop offering those controls on codex rows.**
- **`status.json` keeps its wire contract** (SYNC.md principle 5). The typed
  `Fallback` gained `last_resort` / `check_weekly` / `check_scoped` /
  `weekly_threshold`; a new `codex_fallback(codex, name)` fills the block upstream
  leaves `None`, because ccsbar renders the codex chain from it. `StatusBody`
  gained `last_switch`, `last_error`, `weekly_switch_threshold`, `burn_aware`,
  `forecast`.
- **Deleted:** `src/codex/` entire, `src/loopback.rs` (381 lines — both logins
  carry their own PKCE and listener upstream, so the fork's shared binder had no
  callers), `tests/inline/{codex,codex_actions,codex_oauth,codex_poll}.rs`,
  `RotationProbe`, `CodexStandbyPacing`, `oauth::http_error`,
  `CODEX_PLAN_CACHE_FILE`, `Daemon.codex_follow_memo`.
- **Added:** `switch_profile_discard_locked` (the tick already holds guard +
  flock; the public twin takes the guard internally and would deadlock),
  `codex_auth::id_token_email()` for the codex row caption, `Hash` on `Harness`
  (the daemon keys a per-harness backoff map by it), `"devices"` reserved.

**SYNC.md §6 bit four times again** — a `both` concatenation eats the first
side's function tail, and it always surfaces as "unclosed delimiter", never as a
semantic error: `daemon/tick.rs` (`reclaim_live_slot`), `oauth.rs`
(`http_error`), `profile.rs` (`update_app_state`), `tui/render/usage.rs`
(`header_lines`), plus six test files. Each was restored from the pre-merge side.

#### Where it stands

- `cargo test` — **4067 passed, 0 failed**, 11 ignored. `cargo fmt` clean.
  `cargo clippy --all-targets` has ONE warning, `tui/render/footer.rs:334`,
  byte-identical to upstream's own copy at the same line (local clippy 1.96 is
  stricter than their CI) — not ours, same standing call as UPS-14.
- The 142 test-compile errors were cleared across 16 files by a 32-agent
  fan-out (one fixer + one independent auditor per file, the auditor reading
  the diff for weakened assertions rather than the fixer's own report).
  **Zero audit violations.** Every deletion is a test whose setup needed a field
  that no longer exists — `Profile.harness`, `AppState.active_codex_profile`,
  `crate::codex::*` — and each is reported with its reason in the run log.

**Clearing the suite surfaced four real defects that a red suite was hiding.**
Three broke the published contract both menu-bar clients read:

1. **`fallback_chain` was dropped from `StatusBody` outright.** Only its codex
   twin survived the merge, so every client rendered an EMPTY claude chain.
2. **`last_switch` gained a `skip_serializing_if`** contradicting its own
   `required = true`: the key vanished until the daemon's first switch, and a
   client cannot tell "no switch yet" from "old daemon" without it.
3. **`codex_snapshot_at` was filled from the USAGE CACHE mtime** while its own
   doc comment says it is when the login was captured. ccsbar prints it as
   "login captured 3d ago" BESIDE the usage freshness it already shows, so it
   would have printed the poll age twice and called the older one a capture.
4. `LOGIN_FLAGS` carried `--codex` and `--browser` twice — the merge re-added a
   fork tail for flags upstream now owns. Same marker-free clap collision as
   UPS-14; `grep` the enum after every merge.

The ureq canary (`ureq_recv_response_timeout_kills_the_streaming_body`) fired
exactly as it was written to: the deadline it warned about is headers-only in
the ureq this merge brought in. It now pins THAT, and fails if a future ureq
widens it back over the body. `timeout_recv_response` still stays off
`PROXY_AGENT` — no longer for safety, but because SSE headers arrive
immediately on a 200 and connect + global already bound a wedged connection.

#### The migration (`src/migrate_codex_split.rs`) — written, tested, NOT RUN

`clauth migrate-codex [--dry-run]`, plus a `doctor` check that notices it is
owed. Deliberately not automatic: it renames live credential files.

What it does, in a crash-safe and idempotent order — stores first, then the
codex roster, then the legacy keys last:

- moves each codex profile into `codex-profiles.toml` with the slot, chain,
  and the `wrap_off` / `weekly_switch_threshold` the fork shared between both
  chains (it had no codex-side twin, so carrying the claude values is what
  preserves the configured behaviour),
- renames `profiles/<name>/codex-auth.json` → `auth.json`, **never over an
  existing one** — a half-run migration or an adopt leaves a LIVE chain there,
  and clobbering it would install a spent refresh token,
- strips the dead `harness` key from every `config.toml` and the two legacy
  keys from `profiles.toml`, **editing the text rather than round-tripping**
  so an operator's next diff shows the keys that went, not a reformat,
- classifies off the profile's OWN `config.toml`, never the legacy chain list:
  a claude account hand-added to `codex_fallback_chain` would otherwise be
  filed under the codex roster and refreshed as an auth.json,
- refuses outright if a codex roster already exists that disagrees.

13 tests, all green, every one against a `HomeSandbox`. One of them caught a
real bug in the key-stripper: it kept matching after a table header, so a
`[herdr]` carrying its own `harness` would have lost it.

**It has NOT been run against the real `~/.clauth`, and will not be without
telling AX first.** It is also ordered after the deploy, not before: the running
0.15.1 daemon still reads the legacy layout, so migrating under it would hide
the codex accounts from the binary currently serving.

#### Deployed 2026-09-19

`main` fast-forwarded and pushed to `0e6891b6`; clauth **0.15.2 live**, daemon
and proxy on it. Rollback kit: `~/clauth-ups18-rollback-20260919-012105/`
(0.15.1 binary, a `~/.clauth` tarball, and the operator's pre-adopt
`~/.codex/auth.json`, all 0600).

Order used, and why: both LaunchAgents **booted out** (KeepAlive respawns a
plain `pkill`) → binary swapped onto a fresh inode → migration run with nothing
else writing → agents bootstrapped. The new daemon's first read saw both rosters,
so the codex accounts were never invisible to a running binary.

**Three things the live run found that the suite had not:**

1. **The migration left every codex name in the claude roster.** Its array edit
   handled single-line arrays; clauth renders its own state with
   `to_string_pretty`, which puts any array of more than one element on its own
   lines, and every fixture had been single-line. It reported success and the
   feed published all five codex accounts twice, once per harness. Fixed
   (`0e6891b6`): arrays read until their brackets balance; a repair path for the
   half-split state (a name both rosters hold, dropped from the claude side only
   on a positive codex signal — the store present, no claude credential — with
   the existing codex state left authoritative); and a pre-write check for the
   invariant itself, so a missed edit refuses instead of reporting success. Five
   new tests shaped like the daemon's own render; putting the single-line
   behaviour back fails all five. Re-run repaired the live file.
2. **`~/.codex/auth.json` was a plain copy, not a link.** The fork wrote the
   operator slot as a file; upstream's engine assumes it is a symlink into the
   active profile's store, and its stand-down only sees `clauth start`
   sessions. With direct-mode codex reading a separate copy, the first standby
   refresh would strand codex on a spent token — or codex's own refresh would
   get the store falsely quarantined. Both copies still held the identical chain,
   so it was collapsed with upstream's own adopt (`clauth login ax-codex-xfx
   --codex`, an atomic symlink swap): one physical file, same inode, confirmed.
   While linked, `codex login` / `codex logout` reach ax-codex-xfx's chain
   through the link and revoke it server-side.
3. **Schema 2 blinded both GUI clients.** The merge brought upstream's
   `status.json` schema 2 (one rename, `auth_status` `expiring` → `expired`), and
   ccsbar and Pulse both gated on `== 1`: ccsbar showed a bare gauge and "update
   ccsbar". Both now refuse only a schema NEWER than they know (ccsbar
   `0fcc971`, Pulse `856ef41`); Pulse's footer takes both spellings and says
   "login expired". **Check every client's schema gate before deploying a sync
   that moves the schema.**

Verified live after the fixes: feed has 8 entries, no duplicates (3 claude, 5
codex, emails published); the migration re-runs clean; the daemon log shows only
`running` since restart; a `GET /models` through the proxy returned 200 in
0.29 s, served by `ax-code-bk` — the pool reads the new roster and routes around
the spent account; ccsbar's label came back to the fleet figures and matches the
feed under its installed settings.

**Operational state worth knowing.** The active codex account `ax-codex-xfx` —
the one the operator slot links to, so the one direct-mode codex uses — is at
**100% of its week**, while `ax-code-bk` and `ax-codex-cl` sit at 0%. The codex
chain is empty, so nothing moves it. That is a live switch and AX's to make
(`clauth switch ax-code-bk`, or add members to `fallback_chain` in
`codex-profiles.toml` to arm auto-switch).

The installed binary predates one cosmetic commit (the repair-case wording of
`migrate-codex --dry-run`); it prints only when there is something to migrate,
which on this machine there no longer is.
