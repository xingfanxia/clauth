//! Registry of live `clauth start` sessions.
//!
//! One file per session at `~/.clauth/live_sessions/<sid>.json`, mirroring the
//! `~/.clauth/jobs/` convention ([`crate::mcp::jobs`]): a row is keyed by a
//! session id nobody else writes, so the file needs no ownership arbitration of
//! its own. Rows are filed by SESSION, never under the profile they launched on
//! — a session that swaps member would be misfiled the moment it moved.
//!
//! Two writers share a row, and both constraints they need are structural rather
//! than written down:
//!
//! - **The read is inside the lock, not just the write.** [`update`] is the only
//!   mutation path and it loads a FRESH row under [`with_state_lock`], hands the
//!   caller a borrow that cannot outlive the hold, and stores before releasing.
//!   There is deliberately no public load/store pair: a row read before a swap
//!   and written after would silently revert whatever the other writer put there
//!   in between.
//! - **Field ownership is a type, not a comment.** The daemon reaches its two
//!   fields through [`DaemonFields`] and the session its three through
//!   [`SessionFields`]; neither view can name the other's. Each still stores the
//!   whole freshly-loaded row, so writing one side preserves the other's.
//!
//! Liveness is the session's flock, exactly as for its runtime tree: a row is
//! dead once the marker named by its own `start_profile` + `isolated` +
//! `session_id` is no longer held, and `runtime::gc_stale_runtimes` reaps it
//! there (that module owns the marker layout; this one never rebuilds it).
