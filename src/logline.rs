//! Timestamped log lines for daemon-visible events, routed off any interactive
//! console.
//!
//! One entry point ([`logline!`]), three sinks picked from the process context:
//!
//! - **daemon** ([`enable_timestamps`] flipped once at `serve()`): stderr, which
//!   the supervisor redirects to `daemon.log`. ISO-8601-UTC stamped.
//! - **interactive TUI / CLI on a terminal**: `~/.clauth/clauth.log`. Here stderr
//!   IS the ratatui alternate screen, so a bare line from a background scheduler
//!   thread paints straight over the accounts pane (the 2026-07-14 corruption
//!   report). The line is stamped and diverted to the log file instead.
//! - **piped / redirected stderr** (CI, `2>file`): stderr, bare — the caller
//!   already chose where those bytes land.
//!
//! `daemon.log` lines used to carry no timestamps — the 2026-07-09 broken-active
//! incident had to be reconstructed by guessing switch/quarantine ordering from
//! bare lines. Every daemon-reachable event now dates itself.
