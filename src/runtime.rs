//! Per-profile persistent `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` used by `clauth start`.
//!
//! All `clauth start <profile>` sessions for the same profile share a
//! runtime tree at `~/.clauth/profiles/<profile>/runtime/`. Its
//! `.credentials.json` mirrors the profile's canonical creds so concurrent
//! sessions observe a single chain of refresh tokens. A watchdog thread in
//! each parent process keeps the runtime tree and canonical state in sync.
//!
//! Two transport modes, picked per profile at acquire time:
//!
//! - **Real symlinks** (Unix, plus Windows with developer mode or admin):
//!   the runtime tree is a forest of symlinks into `~/.claude/`, and
//!   `.credentials.json` is a symlink into the profile's canonical creds.
//!   The watchdog only repairs the `.credentials.json` link when Claude
//!   Code's `unlink + write` re-login replaces it with a regular file.
//!
//! - **Fake symlinks** (Windows without symlink privilege): the runtime
//!   tree is built by recursive copy, and `.credentials.json` is a regular
//!   file. The watchdog walks both sides every tick and reconciles by
//!   "latest mtime wins" so a re-login on either side propagates to the
//!   other before another session can pick up a stale refresh token.
//!
//! Reference counting lives in a sibling `sessions/` directory: each
//! session creates `sessions/<pid>-<n>` and holds an exclusive `flock(2)` on
//! it for its lifetime. The `-<n>` suffix keeps the file unique per acquire,
//! so one process holding several concurrent sessions of the same profile
//! (the `clauth mcp` server running overlapping `delegate`s) never collides
//! on a single path. New sessions prune entries whose lock is free (previous
//! holder died) and tear the runtime tree down when no live sessions remain.
