//! The agentgear [`PluginHost`] derive plus the four lifecycle wrappers clauth
//! calls: the Plugin tab's one-key install, the SessionStart self-heal hook, the
//! `clauth start` pre-flight, and the throttled detached heal `clauth mcp` and
//! the daemon share. The hook cannot be the migration trigger — a marketplace
//! that fails to load means the plugin never loads, so the hook never fires —
//! which is why the pre-flight and the detached heal both key off the same gate.
//! Beside the heal runs the installPath convergence leg: CC records plugin
//! installPaths through the installing session's runtime tree, which dies with
//! the session, so every boundary (pre-flight, detached heal, `self-heal` after
//! a binary install) re-roots the dead ones to their `~/.claude` twins through
//! agentgear's byte-surgical re-point.
//!
//! clauth's plugin tree lives in `plugins/` (not the default `plugin/`), so the
//! derive's `tree` attr and `build.rs`'s `assert_plugin_version_at` both name
//! it. The tree itself stays a stock Claude Code plugin — `plugin.json` + the
//! `hooks/` dir — and agentgear supplies the lifecycle around it: materialize
//! the tree, drive `claude plugin marketplace add` + `plugin install`, verify
//! through `plugin list --json`, and stamp a marker self-heal keys on.
//!
//! The `claude`-shelling paths here are the ONLY lifecycle call sites;
//! nothing else in the crate shells out to `claude plugin` (the Plugin tab's
//! probe reads the registry files directly, and the manual `mcpServers` fallback
//! is a settings write). The lifecycle is pinned hermetically by the
//! fake-`claude` tests in `tests/inline/tui_app.rs` and the self-heal pin in
//! `tests/inline/plugin_host.rs` — both `#[cfg(unix)]` (the fake CLI is a
//! shell shim), so a Windows CI leg does not run them.
