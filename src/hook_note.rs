//! `clauth hook-profile-changed-note` — tell a running conversation when the
//! account behind it changed.
//!
//! A conversation can move accounts three ways and none of them says so: a
//! resume under another profile keeps the Claude Code session id and appends to
//! the same transcript, a `clauth switch` lands while a global session works,
//! and a `--with-fallback` session executes a credential swap mid-run. One
//! predicate answers all three — which account this conversation's credentials
//! resolve to right now, against the last value clauth told this conversation —
//! so this reads a hook payload on stdin and emits `additionalContext` when those
//! two differ. A second emit, the headroom nudge, rides the same subcommand: a
//! parent-scope `Task` (agent-spawn) fire whose account's 5h window is
//! exhausted, or burning toward the cap, with nothing left to catch the
//! failure earns it (r8 gate; r7 shipped the static form). r9: the switched
//! spelling appends the new account's live 5h window percent — the same
//! disk-cache read the nudge uses — so the reader no longer has to call
//! `profiles` for the deciding figure; a usage-less account keeps the
//! sentence unchanged.
//!
//! **Not the MCP `instructions` block.** That block is built once per process,
//! so it cannot carry a mid-conversation change at all, and rewriting the front
//! of a live context invalidates the cached prefix behind it.
//!
//! Three properties carry the design:
//!
//! - **The account comes from the tier walk, never the runtime directory name.**
//!   After a swap the directory keeps the profile the session LAUNCHED on while
//!   the credential link points elsewhere, so a path-derived name answers "which
//!   directory" rather than "which account".
//! - **A stat gates the resolution, and a TTL bounds what the stat misses.**
//!   This runs on every tool call, so the record carries a stamp of the
//!   resolution's inputs and skips it when nothing moved. The stamp is the
//!   credential store plus a hash of [`crate::profile::reload_fingerprint`],
//!   which is the crate's own predicate for "could a config reload change the
//!   answer" and covers every per-profile `config.toml` that two hand-rolled
//!   stats did not. [`RESOLUTION_TTL`] is the correctness backstop rather than
//!   an optimisation: it turns anything the fingerprint still misses from an
//!   unbounded miss into a bounded one. Two costs, and the doc used to price
//!   only the first (both measured by review, 2026-08-21, debug build):
//!   a fire that OPENS the gate runs `load_config`, which chmod-walks the whole
//!   `~/.clauth` tree, so this process mutates the filesystem when it resolves
//!   (~3.1 ms at 0 entries, ~5.9 ms at 2000, against a ~2.2 ms spawn floor);
//!   and `reload_fingerprint` runs on EVERY fire, open or closed, at a readdir
//!   plus two stats per profile (+342 µs at 2 profiles, +523 at 30, +651 at 60).
//!   The second is the price of the gate being sound at all, and it scales with
//!   profile count rather than with anything this module controls.
//! - **One record per SCOPE, not per conversation.** A `PostToolUse` fired
//!   inside a subagent carries `agent_id`; a single shared told-flag would let
//!   the first subagent to fire consume the note while the main thread never
//!   hears it. Separate files keep two SCOPES off each other's bytes, and that
//!   is all they do: every main-thread parallel tool call fires with no
//!   `agent_id` and so shares one record, which is why the read-modify-write
//!   below is flock-held (measured by review: 4 concurrent fires emitted the
//!   note 2-4 times in 30 of 30 trials before the lock).
//!
//! - **The nudge says what the chain cannot save.** A `Task` fire spends the
//!   same 5h pool an agent spawn is refused against, and nothing in the turn's
//!   context names the window before the 429 lands. The nudge answers "would a
//!   switch catch this": the burn-projection gate r8 ships, the fallback-chain
//!   walk replayed over the disk cache, and the live-session registry's
//!   `follows_chain` — a session the chain may move already hears about the
//!   move one tool call after it lands. Suppression and re-arm ride the same
//!   record the account note uses.
//!
//! A failure is silence at exit 0 wherever this module can make it one, because
//! a hook that errors on a tool call breaks the conversation it exists to
//! inform. The one path it does not own is [`crate::out`]: a stdout write error
//! that is not `BrokenPipe` panics there by that module's deliberate contract,
//! which exits 101.
