//! A profile's harness is implied by WHICH STATE FILE it lives in — claude
//! profiles in `profiles.toml` ([`crate::profile::AppState`]), codex profiles
//! in `codex-profiles.toml` ([`crate::codex_profiles::CodexState`]) — never by
//! a field inside `AppState`, a dir-name suffix, or a load-order handshake.
//! File membership is what an old binary cannot misread: it never opens the
//! codex file, so it cannot drop or corrupt codex state, and `profiles.toml`
//! keeps its exact pre-codex meaning. This enum is only the in-memory answer
//! to "which file did this name come from"; converting a profile across
//! harnesses is delete + recreate, not a flag flip.

///   first comment reads "API key via env var takes precedence over any other
///   auth method"): `CODEX_API_KEY` first, then `CODEX_ACCESS_TOKEN`, and only
