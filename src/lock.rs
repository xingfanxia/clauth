//! Cross-process serialization of state mutations.
//!
//! All disk writes that touch shared clauth state (profiles.toml, per-profile
//! config/credentials, ~/.claude/settings.json, .credentials.json symlink) run
//! under an exclusive advisory file lock on ~/.clauth/.lock. This stops two
//! concurrent clauth instances from interleaving read-modify-write cycles and
//! losing each other's changes, racing OAuth refresh-token rotations, or
//! clobbering the active-profile symlink.
//!
//! The lock is re-entrant within the same thread so high-level actions
//! (e.g. `switch_profile`) can take the lock and still call helpers that take
//! it themselves without deadlocking. Two different threads of the same process
//! calling `with_state_lock` concurrently are fully serialized — only one
//! executes its closure at a time.
//!
//! Acquiring the cross-process flock is bounded by [`STATE_LOCK_TIMEOUT`]. A
//! blocking flock has no deadline, so a lease-holding fetcher whose rotation path
//! waits on a lock another clauth process holds forever would pin the usage-fetch
//! lease and stand every TUI down permanently (no watchdog covers the scheduler
//! thread). A bounded wait turns that silent wedge into a [`StateLockTimeout`] the
//! caller retries instead of a hang.
