//! Globally-ordered locks that enforce a single acquisition order in code.
//!
//! Every shared lock in clauth carries a *rank* — its position in one global
//! order. A thread may only acquire a lock whose rank is strictly greater than
//! the highest rank it already holds. Acquiring out of that order is the
//! classic lock-order-inversion that deadlocks, so we assert it the moment a
//! lock is taken. What used to be prose ("`usage_store` before `config`", "never
//! two leaf mutexes at once", "`RotationGuard` outermost") is now an executable
//! check that fails loudly in tests and dev runs.
//!
//! The assertion and its bookkeeping are `cfg(debug_assertions)`-only: release
//! builds compile the rank stack out entirely, so [`RankedMutex`] is a
//! zero-overhead wrapper around [`std::sync::Mutex`] in production.
//!
//! ## Deriving the order
//!
//! Only *nested* holdings constrain the order — a sequential acquire-then-drop
//! imposes nothing. The order below is the transitive closure of every nested
//! holding in the codebase:
//!
//! - `RotationGuard` is held across the OAuth HTTP round trip — outermost.
//! - `partition_due`: `last_fetched` → `activity`.
//! - `apply_usage`: `usage_store` → `usage_status` → `config`.
//! - rotation/save sites: `config` → state flock → `activity`.
//! - `/profile` TTL clock: `rotation` → `profile_ttl` (post-401 retry) and
//!   `config` → `profile_ttl` (the account-swap actions that expire it).
//!
//! Standalone leaves (`refetch_queue`, the `pending_*` sets) are never nested
//! with another tracked lock; they are ranked above the rest so that a future
//! accidental nesting under any held lock still *increases* the rank rather than
//! inverting it.
