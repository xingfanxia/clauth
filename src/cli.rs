//! `clauth`'s command grammar as clap derive types. The doc comments here ARE
//! the help copy: clap maps a comment's first paragraph to `-h` and the whole
//! comment to `--help`, so each command's prose lives beside the variant it
//! documents and the root stays a two-column table.
//!
//! Three shapes are not plain subcommands and are load-bearing: a bare
//! `clauth` launches the TUI ([`Cli::command`] is `None`), a bare unrecognized
//! word switches to the profile of that name ([`Command::External`]), and
//! `clauth start <profile> <claude args…>` forwards every token `start` does
//! not declare to `claude` untouched, leading hyphens included.
