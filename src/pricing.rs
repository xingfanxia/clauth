//! Model price table — fetches per-token USD rates so the Tokens tab can show
//! API-equivalent cost (what the recorded usage *would* cost at pay-as-you-go
//! API rates; clauth users are on subscription plans, so this reads as "value
//! extracted", not a bill).
//!
//! # Source
//!
//! The ai-pricelog index (`index.json` on the `dist` branch of
//! uwuclxdy/ai-pricelog, version 4): a `sources` object mapping provider name
//! → model id → a row whose `rates` object maps a price axis to USD per
//! million tokens. clauth models four axes (`input`, `output`, `cache_read`,
//! `cache_write`); every other axis the store carries (`cache_write_1h`,
//! `image`, `audio`, `internal_reasoning`, …) has no bucket to charge to and
//! is ignored, as are `limits`, `fees` and `provenance`. A row may carry
//! `effective_at` (prices apply from that date on; earlier dates price
//! nothing) and `overrides` entries, each a `when` plus override `rates`, a
//! `quota_multiplier`, or both. A `when` takes `days` (lowercase weekday
//! names, already UTC calendar days), `window` (an `[HHMM, HHMM]` pair),
//! `min_tokens` (a token-volume threshold) and `timezone` — provenance only:
//! the store converted the schedule to UTC at build time, so re-deriving
//! `days` from the zone would shift it twice. An override axis left absent
//! inherits the row's base; later entries override earlier matching ones. A
//! row carrying `removed_at` is delisted and prices nothing.
//!
//! Whether a row is RESOLD is a per-row comparison against the catalog, not a
//! provider allowlist: the row is first-party when the model's `vendor` and
//! the provider's are the same named vendor. A provider publishing no
//! `vendor` resells everything, a model the catalog gives no vendor is
//! nobody's first-party row, and a pair the catalog does not name has no
//! maker to compare — all three are resales. Resold rows drop at distill, so
//! no lookup path can land on a reseller's markup, and a MIXED provider comes
//! out right with no special case: dashscope keeps its qwen rows and drops
//! the deepseek / glm / kimi ids it resells.
//!
//! Dated rates come from the store's history ndjson (`history.ndjson`),
//! fetched alongside the index: one JSON row per line, every row carrying
//! `observed_at` (the day the scraper saw it), optionally `effective_at` (the
//! day the price applies FROM — a retro-dated change) and `removed: true`
//! (the model delisted from that day on). A query date prices at the row with
//! the greatest `observed_at` among that `(source, model_id)` key's rows whose
//! `effective_at ?? observed_at` falls on or before the date, back to the
//! store's oldest row. A removal row winning a day's walk prices nothing for
//! that day, and a price row appended after a removal re-lives the key from
//! its own applies day. The same resold guard applies to history rows, so a
//! reseller's copy of an id can neither price it nor delist it.
//! Cross-source twin-ness resolves through the catalog's model registry
//! (canonical id → each source's spellings of it): a delisted key whose
//! canonical id a live key holds never prices any date, and a pair the
//! catalog does not name stays its own key.
//!
//! Api-alias ids (`deepseek-chat`, `deepseek-reasoner`) name a served model,
//! not a page: no index row and no history key carries them, so they resolve
//! through the catalog's alias chains (`catalog/aliases.json`) — a dated
//! chain per alias, one record per canonical model that served it. A query
//! day prices at the record whose `from <= day < to` window covers it, at
//! that canonical's own store walk for the day; a day no record covers prices
//! nothing (deepseek retired both aliases on 2026-07-24, and past that day
//! they dash). A claude session's variant spellings (`deepseek-v4-pro-thinking`)
//! carry a suffix no page id has; one trailing `-<suffix>` group from a known
//! variant list strips and retries once the ladder misses, never remapping an
//! id a row carries verbatim.
//!
//! # Design (mirrors `status.rs`)
//!
//! TUI-free: owns the data model, the HTTP fetch, the distill step, and the
//! on-disk cache, but never touches ratatui. A background thread cold-loads the
//! disk cache (so cost renders instantly and offline once primed), then fetches
//! the live feed and refreshes on a slow cadence — prices change rarely. The UI
//! thread reads [`PricingEvent`]s and holds the latest [`PriceTable`]; no shared
//! lock crosses the thread boundary, only the channel does.
//!
//! Every successful fetch appends a snapshot to the table's local snapshot
//! log (skipped when the distilled models are byte-identical to the last
//! snapshot's, capped at [`HISTORY_CAP`] snapshots). The snapshot log is the
//! offline cache only — nothing dates off it: dating is the store walk above.
//! A table holding no store history (a cache written before this split) keeps
//! the snapshot walk — newest snapshot with `captured <= date`, oldest
//! snapshot for older dates — until the next successful fetch persists the
//! store.
//!
//! # Cost basis
//!
//! Cost is computed **per model** and summed — never via a blended rate, since
//! family rates differ up to 10× (Opus $5/$25 vs Haiku $1/$5 per 1M). It always
//! counts cache tokens (they cost real money on the API), independent of the
//! Tokens tab's `count_cache` display toggle. Models with no matching rate
//! (unknown / unpriced providers) contribute nothing and are surfaced as such.
