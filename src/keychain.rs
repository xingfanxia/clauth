//! macOS Keychain access for the `Claude Code-credentials` login item.
//!
//! Claude Code on macOS stores its OAuth login in the login Keychain (a generic
//! password: service `Claude Code-credentials`, account = the OS login name), NOT
//! in `~/.claude/.credentials.json`. So clauth's symlink swap is cosmetic on
//! macOS unless the switched account is also written here — Claude Code keeps
//! reading the Keychain.
//!
//! **Every write is a READ-MODIFY-WRITE.** Claude Code keeps ONE item holding
//! ONE JSON object: the login `claudeAiOauth` beside `mcpOAuth` (the
//! per-MCP-server logins, which belong to no Claude account) and four
//! account-scoped keys. `add-generic-password -U`
//! replaces that whole object, so a write serializing the login alone signed the
//! operator out of every MCP server on every switch. Which siblings survive is
//! [`Keep`]'s decision, and it mirrors the two rules the file path already has:
//! a switch imports from another account's store and takes an allowlist
//! (`claude::carry_live_extra_over`), a rotation rewrites this account's own item
//! and keeps everything (`profile::preserve_extra_blocks`).
//!
//! **The read costs ONE access prompt, ever.** macOS gates a read on the ITEM's
//! own ACL and binds the grant to the CALLING binary, so an "Always Allow"
//! against Apple's stable, code-signed `/usr/bin/security` sticks permanently,
//! where a grant against clauth's own `cargo build` binary would die at the next
//! rebuild under its changed ad-hoc signature. That is why this shells out
//! instead of linking `security-framework` (CCSwitcher's approach), and it is now
//! load-bearing for reads as well as writes. Measured at a console 2026-08-12: an
//! item ACL'd to a different binary (`-T /usr/bin/false`, the shape CC's own item
//! has) raised a dialog on the first `find-generic-password` and answered
//! silently on the second. Bound on that: the probe ran against a throwaway item,
//! never `Claude Code-credentials` itself, so persistence against CC's own item
//! follows from the grant being per-item rather than from an observation.
//!
//! **A failed read never fails the write.** A locked keychain, an ACL refusal on
//! a headless ssh session (`errSecInteractionNotAllowed`), or a dialog nobody
//! answers inside [`security_deadline`] degrades to writing the incoming blob
//! alone, and names the loss on the event line. Completing a switch is
//! load-bearing where preserving MCP logins is a convenience, the same posture
//! `claude.rs::carry_live_extra_best_effort` takes on the file path, and refusing
//! instead would strand every headless macOS switch on the outgoing account.
//! `claude.rs` wires all of it behind `#[cfg(target_os = "macos")]` + [`enabled`].
//!
//! **A successful write is only believed once read back.** `add-generic-password`
//! exiting 0 is the tool's word, not proof the item holds the bytes sent: the
//! `-i` line truncation (#66) exited 0 while the item held cut-off JSON, and
//! nothing surfaced until a later read failed to parse it. So every write reads
//! the item back RAW and byte-compares against the JSON it sent
//! ([`verify_outcome`], the ruling on what that proved in
//! [`write_disposition`]). Byte-equal is the only silent outcome. Different bytes,
//! or an item that reads back ABSENT after a reported success, is a write KNOWN
//! corrupt — the switch fails rather than complete on a lie, the read-back bytes
//! are quarantined first, and the profile store still holds the intended login,
//! so retrying the switch re-runs the write. A read-back that cannot run at all
//! (the hold's subprocess budget already spent, [`security_deadline`] expiry, a
//! read refusal over ssh) leaves the write LANDED BUT UNVERIFIED and the switch
//! COMPLETE: the same refusal-of-refusal a failed read takes, because an
//! unverifiable write must not fail a completed switch.
//!
//! **Unparseable bytes are quarantined, never destroyed.** A read that answers
//! with bytes which are not the JSON object CC expects is usually a TRUNCATED
//! one — the `claudeAiOauth` head survives with its tail cut (#66, #76) — and
//! the overwrite/delete that used to treat such a read as "unreadable" is what
//! turned one corruption into a lost login plus every MCP login in the item.
//! The two sites that act on a failed read — the merge that overwrites the item
//! and the sign-out that deletes it — park the raw bytes under
//! `~/.clauth/keychain-quarantine/` first ([`quarantine_item_bytes`], the
//! `atomic_write_600` posture the parked `mcp-logins.json` already holds) and
//! name the file on the event line. The write or delete still lands: quarantine
//! preserves the evidence, it does not refuse the switch.

///
/// **10 s is the PER-CALL ceiling: the window one `security` invocation gets

/// answer the one-time ACL dialog before the call gives up on them. A mirror
/// is now THREE invocations (a read, then a write or delete, then the write's
/// read-back verification, [`verify_write`]), where the deadlines above this
/// were sized against two: `lock.rs`'s 25 s state-lock timeout and the daemon's
/// 30 s `WATCHDOG_DEADLINE` sit against a 20 s mirror, and the daemon's
/// comment says to bound this shell-out rather than loosen them. Inside a hold
/// the clamp below still caps the AGGREGATE at that 20 s however many calls
/// share it; outside one (the rotation mirror, which `oauth.rs` runs after its
/// lock closure ends) a mirror's worst case is now 30 s against
/// `runtime::KEYCHAIN_MIRROR_BUDGET`'s 20 — under-covered by exactly the
/// verification call, deliberately left un-retuned here and reported to the
/// caller instead. What keeps that gap safe is the verify leg's own failure
/// mode: an UNVERIFIABLE write completes rather than failing, so the
/// under-coverage costs a lock-waiter's margin, never a correct switch.
///
/// This is the PER-CALL ceiling only. What a waiting peer actually feels is the
/// whole flock hold, and a hold can run more than one mirror
/// (`adopt_first_login`'s relink, then the switch's own), so [`security_deadline`]
/// clamps this to `lock::SUBPROCESS_BUDGET`, the aggregate one hold may spend.
///
/// Measured on `mac-6` 2026-08-12: a real `add-generic-password -U` costs 22-29 ms
/// and a `find-generic-password -w` 18-19 ms, so the happy path keeps a ~210x
/// margin against either bound. A deadline only ever binds a stuck keychain, where
/// both legs burn it. What the 10 s costs there is an operator with 10 s rather
/// than 20 s to answer the one-time ACL dialog — the READ leg, which degrades to a
/// login-only write and re-prompts next switch. The WRITE leg does not degrade: it
/// fails the switch, so a locked keychain that prompts for a password rather than
/// refusing outright has half as long to be answered before that.
