//! `clauth sessions [--json] [--tokens]`, `clauth resume <id|latest>
//! [--profile <name>]`, `clauth info <id|latest>`, and the two-name form of
//! `clauth switch <sid> <profile>` (one name is the global account switch,
//! `main::cmd_switch`) — the CLI surface over the session index
//! ([`crate::sessions`]). The index owns the heavy work (transcript walk,
//! preview redaction, token/cost annotation, owner stamping); this module
//! only flattens it, renders it, and drives the account-aware resume spawn.
//! `switch` is the exception: it touches no transcript at all, only the
//! live-session registry ([`crate::live_sessions`]).
//!
//! # What each command reads
//! Only `sessions` browses, so only `sessions` builds the index. `resume` and
//! `info` want one row, and take [`crate::sessions::find_session`] /
//! [`crate::sessions::newest_session`] instead: a filename-and-mtime walk, then
//! the head of the single transcript they resolved to. Those two read the shared
//! store only, so a target the index would have found in a live isolated runtime
//! is reported against [`crate::sessions::live_isolated_holds`] (the same tier-1
//! walk) rather than called missing — see [`Resolved`]. The token and cost
//! figures are a third tier above even the index — a full read of every
//! transcript — so `sessions` leaves them blank until `--tokens` asks.
//!
//! Over the maintainer's own 12k-session, 5.4 GB store: `clauth info latest`
//! 11.3 s → 44 ms, `clauth sessions` 20.7 s → 11.3 s, and `--tokens` reproduces
//! the old listing byte for byte.
//!
//! # Exit codes (the `clauth sessions` scripting contract)
//! - `0` success.
//! - `1` a genuine error, INCLUDING "no sessions found".
//! - `2` a usage error (bad flag/args).
//!
//! `1` vs `2` is carried by [`crate::UsageError`] and mapped in
//! [`crate::exit_code`]: a `sessions`/`resume`/`info` dispatch arm returns a
//! `UsageError` for a malformed invocation, and any other `Err` (an empty index
//! included) maps to `1`.
