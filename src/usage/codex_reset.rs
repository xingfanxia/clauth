//! Spending a banked codex usage-limit reset (`clauth use-reset`).
//!
//! The usage poll already READS the banked count off `wham/usage`
//! (`rate_limit_reset_credits.available_count`, published as status.json
//! `codex_reset_credits`). This module is the one place clauth SPENDS one, and
//! only because the operator asked for it: `clauth use-reset <name>` or the
//! menu-bar entry that runs it. Nothing here is on a timer, and nothing retries.
//!
//! The wire is codex's own, verified against openai/codex
//! (`backend-client/src/client/rate_limit_resets.rs`, `types.rs`, and the TUI's
//! `/usage` reset picker): a GET lists the account's credits, and a POST
//! consumes one by id under a fresh idempotency key. codex reads a reply's
//! `code` as a closed set; clauth keeps it an open string, so a code a newer
//! backend adds is reported as unconfirmed rather than failing to parse AFTER
//! the reset may already have been spent.
//!
//! Read-only on the credential: the access token and account id come from the
//! profile store as it stands. A 401 is reported, never answered with a
//! refresh — the store has a single writer (see `crate::codex_auth`).
