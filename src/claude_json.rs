//! Cross-profile `.claude.json` synchronizer.
//!
//! Claude Code keeps one large config file — `~/.claude.json` for normal use —
//! holding user-global state (`projects`, `mcpServers`, `tips`, `userID`)
//! alongside an account-specific `oauthAccount` block and a few billing/usage
//! caches. `clauth start <profile>` runs Claude Code against a per-profile
//! runtime tree with its OWN `.claude.json`, because a single shared file leaks
//! one account's identity into another: Claude Code trusts the cached
//! `oauthAccount` and does not re-derive it from the loaded token on a normal
//! startup (its bootstrap merge keeps the cached identity when the server
//! reports a different account).
//!
//! This module keeps every clauth-managed `.claude.json` (the global file plus
//! each profile runtime's copy) in sync EXCEPT for [`PER_PROFILE_FIELDS`], which
//! each file keeps as its own. Sync is "latest write wins" at file granularity:
//! each tick the newest parseable file is the source for the shared fields,
//! overlaid onto every other file while preserving that file's per-profile
//! fields. Atomic writes plus write-only-on-change make it convergent and safe
//! against Claude Code's concurrent in-place writes — a file caught mid-write
//! fails to parse and is simply skipped until the next tick. The merge itself
//! lives in [`crate::jsonsync`], shared with the `settings.json` reconciler.
