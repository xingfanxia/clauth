//! Just enough HTTP/1.1 to serve the REST API, over any `Read + Write`.
//!
//! Generic over the stream so production drives it with a rustls
//! `StreamOwned<ServerConnection, TcpStream>` and the tests drive it with a
//! plain loopback `TcpStream` — routing, auth, and every parser limit below are
//! therefore testable without a handshake or a certificate.
//!
//! Deliberately not a web framework and deliberately not the one-line parser in
//! `oauth_login.rs` (which discards the method, never reads headers or a body,
//! and has no size cap — fine for a loopback OAuth redirect, not for something
//! listening on a LAN).
//!
//! Persistent connections and pipelining are both supported, which puts the
//! whole burden on message framing being unambiguous. Two rules carry that:
//! `Content-Length` is the ONLY framing accepted (chunked is refused outright,
//! and two `Content-Length` headers that disagree are a hard error), and any
//! framing error closes the connection instead of trying to resynchronize.
//! Together those remove the ambiguity request smuggling is built on: there is
//! never a second reading of where one message ends and the next begins.
//!
//! Pipelined requests are served strictly in order, one at a time, so responses
//! cannot be reordered relative to the requests that produced them.
