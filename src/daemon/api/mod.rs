//! `clauth daemon --listen` — the TLS REST API.
//!
//! Opt-in, off unless an address is passed. It exists for one deployment: the
//! daemon on the machine that holds the accounts, a client (the tray) on
//! another machine on the same network. Everything else about the daemon stays
//! file-based.
//!
//! Cross-platform, like the rest of clauth: macOS, Linux, and Windows. Only
//! [`tls`] knows which platform it is on — where lego's certificates live and
//! how this host's FQDN is discovered. Nothing else below branches.
//!
//! Shape:
//!   * **TLS always.** There is no plaintext mode and no flag to ask for one —
//!     a bearer token crosses this connection on every request.
//!   * **A device always.** Every route but the pairing redemption needs
//!     `Authorization: Bearer <token>` from a paired device, and the switch
//!     needs one paired with control; see [`devices`], [`pairing`], and the
//!     table in [`routes`].
//!   * **Operations.** The health check, the status feed, the OpenAPI document,
//!     the account switch and the fallback-chain edits (order, per-member
//!     threshold, wrap-off; control devices only), and the pairing redemption.
//!     The switch goes through the same action the MCP tool uses, so anything
//!     needing human eyes is refused here too.
//!   * **Thread per connection**, capped and time-bounded. Connections persist
//!     across requests and serve pipelined ones in order; see [`http`] for the
//!     framing rules that makes safe. No async runtime.
