//! The REST API's TLS identity, taken from this host's lego certificate.
//!
//! lego writes a renewed certificate in place, so reading it at startup means a
//! renewal reaches the listener on the next daemon restart — deliberate: the
//! alternative is re-reading `/etc` on every connection, and a half-written
//! renewal would then take the listener down rather than one restart.
//!
//! Paths are derived from the host's own FQDN, matching lego's layout:
//!
//! ```text
//! /etc/lego/certificates/boson.example.org.crt
//! /etc/lego/certificates/boson.example.org.issuer.crt
//! /etc/lego/certificates/boson.example.org.key
//! ```
//!
//! Only two things here are platform-specific — which directory holds that
//! layout ([`default_cert_dir`]) and how the host's own FQDN is discovered
//! ([`FQDN_COMMAND`]). Everything below them is the same code on macOS, Linux,
//! and Windows.
//!
//! The directory is a default, not a rule: `~/.clauth/tls.json` carries it, is
//! written with this platform's default on first use, and is read back on every
//! start ([`cert_dir`]). That is what lets a Windows box whose lego lives
//! somewhere other than `%AppData%` — or a Linux one behind a packaging
//! convention of its own — serve TLS without a rebuild.
//!
//! The derivation itself can be wrong, though, and no directory setting fixes
//! that: on a tailnet node `hostname -f` answers a name no certificate covers,
//! and `tailscale cert` writes a `<name>.crt`/`<name>.key` pair with no issuer
//! file beside it and none of lego's naming. So the whole derivation is
//! skippable — `--cert`/`--key` name the two files outright ([`CertSource`]),
//! and nothing about the FQDN, the directory, or the issuer file is consulted.
//! A bind on a Tailscale range (100.64.0.0/10, fd7a:115c:a1e0::/48) whose lego
//! derivation still fails for want of a certificate refuses with the
//! `tailscale cert` route and the `--cert`/`--key` flags to pass, instead of
//! lego's missing-file error.
