//! The route table and the one capability check.
//!
//! Every route is a row of [`ROUTES`] carrying the access it needs, and
//! [`handle`] reads that table for dispatch and for the check alike, so no
//! route is served outside it or reached without its check. The surface is
//! narrow on purpose: read the feed, switch the account, redeem a pairing
//! code. A switch is the one mutation the daemon already performs unattended,
//! so exposing it adds no capability the fallback chain does not have;
//! everything that needs a human (a diverged live login, an unprovable
//! identity) is refused here exactly as it is refused for the scheduler and
//! the MCP tool, and the TUI stays the only place to resolve it.
