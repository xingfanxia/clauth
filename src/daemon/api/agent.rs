//! `POST /api/v1/panes/{id}/prompt` and `POST /api/v1/panes/{id}/keys` — the
//! control half of driving a herdr agent from the app: a prompt through
//! `herdr agent prompt`, key presses through `herdr pane send-keys`.
//!
//! herdr's own detection and refusals are the truth the app shows: an agent
//! waiting on a prompt of its own refuses a new one (`agent_blocked`), and the
//! keys route is how it gets its `y`, `enter` or `esc`. Both calls go through
//! the context's herdr seam ([`super::panes::PaneProbe`]), the one place that
//! names the binary and strips the session env, so no test runs a real herdr.
//! The audit line names the pane and the size of what was sent, never its
//! content.
