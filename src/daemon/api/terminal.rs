//! `GET /api/v1/panes/<id>/stream` — the WebSocket terminal bridge.
//!
//! Bridges herdr's hidden `terminal session observe|control` group onto the
//! API: one WebSocket per pane, relaying herdr's newline-delimited JSON frames
//! as text frames verbatim and (on a control-tier device) forwarding the
//! documented control commands back to herdr's stdin. The route is outside the
//! HTTP route table and the OpenAPI document on purpose: OpenAPI covers HTTP
//! only, and the frame vocabulary stays hand-written beside the route table.
//!
//! The device tier decides the mode, never the client: a view-tier device gets
//! `observe` and any data frame it sends closes the socket with a policy code;
//! a control-tier device gets `control`. herdr arbitrates controllers against
//! each other (`--takeover` exists; this bridge never passes it), and both
//! refusal shapes arrive as ordinary `terminal.closed` records, which relay
//! like any other frame before the socket closes.
//!
//! Geometry: a control attach without explicit `--cols/--rows` imposes
//! herdr's 120x40 default on the real pane (measured, T1), yanking the
//! desktop user's layout on every attach. The bridge therefore reads the
//! pane's own rect from `herdr api snapshot` — the only surface that names a
//! pane's width — and attaches at exactly that, so the pane never moves. A
//! client that later sends `terminal.resize` to a phone shape has chosen that
//! deliberately; the resize is forwarded and the audit line says so.
//!
//! A stream honours the connection loop's lifetime and ends there with a clean
//! close the client reconnects through (owner ruling 2026-09-15, row 6: no
//! slot is ever held forever); a reconnect re-attaches at the pane's own
//! geometry, so the mirror resumes rather than resets. Inside its lifetime the
//! bridge's own bounds apply: the 200 ms read slice, the inherited 10 s
//! single-write timeout, a bounded frames channel, and control commands that
//! cross to herdr's stdin on their own untimed-wait-free thread.
