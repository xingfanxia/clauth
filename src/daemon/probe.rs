//! Daemon presence + the single-fetcher lease (dual-scheduler dedup, #27).
//!
//! Three `~/.clauth` flock files, peers in the same dir:
//!   * `clauthd.lock` — the daemon singleton + **presence beacon**. Held for
//!     life by the running daemon; a display-only try-lock tells the TUI header
//!     whether a daemon is up (an advisory lock auto-releases on process death,
//!     so a dead daemon reads as absent on the next probe). Paired with
//!     `status.json`'s freshness it drives the `● daemon` health dot
//!     ([`daemon_health`]). [`singleton_held`] reads the same lock as a decision
//!     for `clauth daemon --status`, where not knowing has to be an error rather
//!     than a hidden dot.
//!   * `clauthd-standby.lock` — the **standby slot** ([`StandbySlot`], #57). One
//!     waiter may park on the singleton lock; every later instance is
//!     [`Claim::Redundant`] and exits, so a spawner that fires repeatedly can no
//!     longer pile up parked daemons.
//!   * `usage-fetch.lock` — the **single-fetcher lease** ([`FetchLease`]).
//!     Exactly one instance (daemon OR a TUI) holds it at a time and does all
//!     usage fetching / rotation / switch decisions while it does; every other
//!     instance hydrates from the shared disk cache. First-come, held for life,
//!     released only on process exit — no preemption, so the switch-decider
//!     never thrashes between processes.
