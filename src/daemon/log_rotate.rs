//! In-place trim of the daemon's supervisor-redirected log.
//!
//! `~/.clauth/daemon.log` is opened by **launchd** (`StandardErrorPath`) with an
//! `O_APPEND` fd that launchd holds for the daemon's whole lifetime and never
//! reopens. That rules out rename-based rotation: renaming the file leaves
//! launchd appending to the renamed inode, so the "new" `daemon.log` stays empty
//! and the real file grows unbounded. The only rotation that survives a held
//! `O_APPEND` fd is an **in-place trim** — rewrite the SAME inode to keep just its
//! tail. launchd's next append lands at the new EOF, so logging continues
//! seamlessly; at most a few bytes written during the trim window are dropped (a
//! diagnostic log, not a ledger — an acceptable, rare loss).
//!
//! Sized for the real worst case (#39 corrected: ~5 MB/day, not "multi-GB in
//! months"), so this is a size cap, not a heavyweight log pipeline.
