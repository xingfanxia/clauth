//! Runs the exact same background refresher the TUI runs (`spawn_refresher`),
//! but with no ratatui loop. Its jobs each tick:
//!   1. execute any auto-switch the scheduler queued (`pending_switch` /
//!      `pending_switch_off`) — this is what makes unattended auto-switch work
//!      with the TUI closed, the operator's core requirement;
//!   2. rewrite `~/.clauth/status.json` atomically (the external read feed);
//!   3. pick up external config changes (a new `clauth login`, a TUI edit).
//!
//! The scheduler already persists `usage_cache.json` inside `apply_outcome`, so
//! the daemon and the TUI share one cache. A single-instance advisory lock keeps
//! two schedulers from double-firing.
