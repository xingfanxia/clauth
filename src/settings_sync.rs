//! Cross-profile `settings.json` synchronizer.
//!
//! `runtime::write_merged_settings` computes each profile's runtime
//! `settings.json` once per `clauth start`, from the `~/.claude/settings.json`
//! base plus that profile's `config.toml` overrides. Without reconciliation a
//! setting the user changes inside a live Claude Code session lands only in that
//! profile's runtime copy: the next start rebuilds from the base and the change
//! is gone, and no sibling profile ever sees it.
//!
//! This module reconciles the same member set the credentials watchdog already
//! ticks: the operator's `~/.claude/settings.json` plus every SHARED profile
//! runtime copy. Newest parseable copy wins for the shared fields; each member
//! keeps its own per-profile fields ([`key_role`]). The merge machinery is
//! [`crate::jsonsync`], shared with the `.claude.json` reconciler.
//!
//! **The base is a sync member, and the write-back target.** Two consequences
//! drive the design:
//!
//! - Writing the winner's shared fields back into `~/.claude/settings.json` is
//!   what stops a thrash: the next `clauth start` recomputes from an
//!   already-updated base and reproduces the same bytes, so the recompute and
//!   the sync agree instead of overwriting each other. A runtimes-only sync
//!   would be undone on every start.
//! - `~/.claude/settings.json` is NOT a pristine operator base.
//!   `claude::apply_profile_to_claude_settings` rewrites the ACTIVE profile's
//!   managed env keys, `apiKeyHelper`, and `model` into that very file on every
//!   switch. It is a member carrying its own per-profile fields, so those must
//!   neither propagate outward nor be overwritten by a sibling's — which the
//!   symmetric [`key_role`] rule gives for free.
//!
//! With no live `clauth start` session there is nothing to reconcile and nothing
//! to lose: teardown discards each session's runtime tree, so the base is the
//! only surviving member and the engine's `members.len() < 2` short-circuit makes
//! a sync a no-op. That is why this runs on the session watchdog and needs no
//! daemon tick — a headless box has no runtime copy that could diverge.
