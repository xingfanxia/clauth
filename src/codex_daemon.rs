//! Codex's shared app-server daemon, and when it still holds a login the
//! operator switched away from.
//!
//! Since codex 0.157 a `codex` TUI is a client of one long-lived app-server
//! daemon (`codex app-server --managed-daemon`); every task runs inside it and
//! `codex resume` reconnects to the same process. The daemon reads
//! `~/.codex/auth.json` once, when it starts. A clauth codex switch repoints
//! that file, so it reaches only a daemon started after the switch: until the
//! daemon restarts, every task keeps spending the previous account (observed
//! 2026-09-27: a resumed task stayed on a week-spent account after a switch).
//! Its token refreshes would also be written through the repointed link into
//! the new account's store.
//!
//! The daemon recreates its control-socket link at every start, so that link's
//! mtime is when it started, and the operator slot's link mtime is when a
//! switch last repointed it.
