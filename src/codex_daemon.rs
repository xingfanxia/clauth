//! Codex's shared app-server daemon, and when it still holds a login the
//! operator switched away from.
//!
//! Since codex 0.157 a `codex` TUI is a client of one long-lived app-server
//! daemon (`codex app-server --managed-daemon`); every task runs inside it and
//! `codex resume` reconnects to the same process. The daemon reads
//! `~/.codex/auth.json` once, when it starts. A clauth codex switch repoints
//! that file, so it reaches only a daemon started after the switch: until the
//! daemon restarts, every task keeps spending the previous account (observed
//! 2026-09-27: a resumed task stayed on a week-spent account after a switch).
//! It does NOT write the old login into the new account's store: codex saves
//! `auth.json` through the link, but every refresh path first re-reads it and
//! refuses on an account-id mismatch (0.157.1 `refresh_token` /
//! `UnauthorizedRecovery`; checked in a sandbox with forged tokens and a local
//! refresh server, 2026-09-28). Once its access token expires it errors with
//! that mismatch instead, until it restarts. No reload message exists that
//! could replace the restart.
//!
//! The daemon recreates its control-socket link at every start and removes it
//! on a clean exit, so that link's mtime is when it started, and the operator
//! slot's link mtime is when a switch last repointed it.
