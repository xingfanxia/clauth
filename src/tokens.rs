//! Token-usage statistics for the "tokens" TUI tab.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! Two-phase load, emitted as two events per run so the tab paints instantly:
//! 1. **Base stats** ([`load_base`]) — parsed from `~/.claude/stats-cache.json`,
//!    which Claude Code maintains as a pre-aggregated lifetime snapshot. A single
//!    small JSON file, so it returns in well under a millisecond and is the tab's
//!    first paint instead of a blank "reading ~/.claude".
//! 2. **Live top-up** ([`merge_topup`]) — appends days from `~/.claude/projects/`
//!    transcripts strictly newer than the cache's `lastComputedDate`, avoiding
//!    double-counting days already in the snapshot. The recursive sweep also
//!    reaches subagent/workflow transcripts under `<session>/subagents/`. Each
//!    response is deduplicated by `message.id` (a content composite when absent,
//!    so an id-less line still dedups), and each message by line `uuid`, so a
//!    response mirrored into more than one file is counted once. Beyond tokens,
//!    the top-up reconstructs post-cutoff message/session/hour counts so the
//!    lifetime card and activity graph track the same live window as the token
//!    bars rather than freezing at `lastComputedDate`.
//!
//! The background sweep keeps a per-file contribution cache ([`TopUpCache`]) so
//! each 90s refresh re-reads only transcripts whose mtime advanced — the rest are
//! re-merged from memory, avoiding a full multi-hundred-MB re-read every cycle.
//!
//! # Durable ledger ([`crate::token_ledger`])
//!
//! The top-up alone is fragile: it assumes transcripts exist for every day after
//! `lastComputedDate`, but CC prunes them past `cleanupPeriodDays`, so a day after
//! a frozen base but before the retention horizon would be counted nowhere. The
//! ledger closes that: each finalized day's split is written once to
//! `~/.clauth/token_ledger.json` and folded back on load, and its watermark
//! becomes the sweep's effective cutoff — so a frozen base can't keep the
//! cold-start read growing either. Days recorded before the hourly axis carry
//! no per-hour buckets; on the first run after an upgrade, a one-shot backfill
//! ([`backfill_corpus`] + [`crate::token_ledger::Ledger::backfill_hours`])
//! re-derives them from the pre-watermark corpus and fills the rows whose flat
//! totals still match, so past days price peak/off-peak exactly where the
//! transcripts still cover them.
//!
//! # Caveat
//!
//! `stats-cache.json` reflects **all** Claude Code usage across all profiles and
//! accounts on this machine (global pool), as do the shared-runtime transcripts.
//! An `--isolated` session keeps its own throwaway store, so its usage is NOT
//! counted here. The top-up reads every JSONL file past the ledger watermark at
//! load time, which may span all profiles that share a home. This is intentional
//! — the tokens tab shows aggregate usage.
