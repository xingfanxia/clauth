//! Stdout that survives the reader leaving.
//!
//! Rust ignores `SIGPIPE`, so a write into a pipe whose reader is gone comes
//! back `EPIPE` and `println!` panics on it — `clauth sessions | head -3`
//! printed a Rust panic and exited 101 where a CLI should just stop. Restoring
//! the default disposition once at startup is the usual fix and the wrong one
//! for this binary: `std` sets no `MSG_NOSIGNAL` on Linux socket writes, so it
//! would also kill the daemon the first time an upstream hung up mid-request.
//! The handling lives at the emitter instead.
//!
//! [`outln!`] and [`out!`] are what the crate prints with, [`errln!`] is the
//! stderr half; a bare `println!` or `eprintln!` under `src/` is the bug this
//! module exists to stop, and a guard test fails on one.
//! `platform::copy_to_clipboard_osc52` is the one sanctioned raw stdout
//! writer, for the OSC 52 clipboard escape, which is a terminal command rather
//! than a line of output.
//!
//! The two halves answer a closed reader differently. Stdout carries the
//! payload, so a gone reader ends the run at exit 0. Stderr carries diagnostics
//! and the fatal-error line, so a gone reader drops the line and the run
//! continues to its own exit code — exiting there would let a closed stderr
//! take down a whole `clauth start` session over a background `logline!`.
//!
//! [`errln!`] is for the FOREGROUND CLI, and keeps the stdout half's strictness
//! about every other write error: a run that cannot write its own error message
//! has lost its only channel to the operator. A background thread has no such
//! channel to lose, so `logline!`'s stderr sink writes best-effort on its own
//! (`logline::write_stderr_line`) rather than panicking a scheduler thread over
//! a full disk. Nothing on a background thread reaches for [`errln!`].
