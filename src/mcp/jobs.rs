//! Disk-backed job store for background `delegate` calls.
//!
//! A background delegate returns a `job_id` at once and finishes on a detached
//! blocking task. The result must outlive the originating tool call AND be
//! collectable later, so it lands on disk at `~/.clauth/jobs/<job_id>.json`
//! rather than an in-memory registry. Writes are atomic (tmp + rename) so a
//! concurrent reader never sees
//! a torn file. No lock is taken: the path is keyed by a unique `job_id` and the
//! finalizing task is the sole writer for its own file — a leaf with no ordering
//! against the runtime/state locks.
//!
//! A BLOCKING delegate whose caller walks away also ends up here
//! (`Handoff::hand_off` promotes its record mid-run), and it writes the same
//! file through the same code — but it is NOT delivered the same way, and the
//! paragraph above does not reach it. Measured on Claude Code 2.1.233: a tool
//! call the client cancelled or timed out dispatches `PostToolUseFailure`, never
//! `PostToolUse`, so the bundled delivery hook never runs for it; and the reply carrying
//! the minted id is dropped by rmcp before it reaches the transport, so the
//! model never learns the id from the call it was minted for. So the record is
//! written to keep the spent window's result rather than to answer that caller,
//! and the id is recovered afterwards by ENUMERATION rather than by delivery:
//! `monitor` with no `job_ids` lists it, `clauth jobs` prints it, and the TUI's
//! delegates pane draws it. All three go through [`list_banded`], and so through
//! [`list`] beneath it.
//!
//! A blocking delegate that is STILL attached to its caller keeps a second
//! spelling here, `<job_id>.live.json` ([`RecordKind::Liveness`]) — the same
//! bytes, heartbeat and all, under a filename no reader can name. It exists so
//! an operator can see a run whose model-facing result is still travelling back
//! through the join. [`RecordKind`] documents why no id resolves that
//! spelling, so nothing collects the liveness file itself. It ends one of
//! three ways. Renamed to the collectable spelling when the caller walks away.
//! Deleted when the run finishes with its caller still there. Converted to a
//! tombstone when the server dies with the caller gone; the tombstone is a
//! collectable record `monitor` then answers and removes.
