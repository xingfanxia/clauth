/// 30 minutes is expected rather than pathological, and without this the call
/// dies while the child keeps spending the target's window.
///
/// `tick` is a callback rather than the [`ProgressSink`] itself, for the reason
/// `read_stdout`'s heartbeat sink is one: an in-process caller cannot build a
/// `Peer<RoleServer>`, so a sink handed in here would swallow every notification
/// and the throttle would have nothing to prove itself against.
///
/// The send is awaited INSIDE the loop, so a backed-up transport leaves the join
/// unpolled for its duration and delays the finished envelope by that much.
/// Accepted rather than fixed: moving the send off the loop costs a spawned task
/// plus a channel, and a transport blocked long enough to matter has already
/// ended the request — a notification is best-effort for exactly that reason
/// ([`ProgressSink`]). It cannot drop the envelope, and it cannot orphan the
/// child, which keeps running on the blocking pool either way.
///
/// On `notifications/cancelled` the ticking stops — there is no point notifying
/// a request id that is gone — and `on_abandon` decides what becomes of the run.
/// A run with a child already spending the target's window is handed off to a
/// job file and this returns [`Joined::HandedOff`], leaving the task to finish
/// detached; anything else keeps the join and waits it out silently, because
