//! Third-party API provider integration.
//!
//! Recognises providers by base URL and fetches provider-specific statistics
//! for display on the Usage and Setup tabs. Each provider lives in its own
//! submodule; this module owns the shared model, HTTP helper, and disk cache.
//!
//! Adding a provider:
//! 1. Create `src/providers/<name>.rs` with `DISPLAY_NAME`, `matches_base_url`,
//!    and `fetch` (mirror [`deepseek`] for balances, [`zai`] for limit bars +
//!    per-model token rows).
//! 2. Add a variant to [`Provider`] and wire it into `from_base_url`,
//!    `display_name`, `console_url` (the page an operator mints the key on —
//!    cite where the vendor publishes it, since a wrong one sends someone to
//!    another product), [`ThirdPartyTarget::throttle_key`], and
//!    [`Provider::fetch`].
//! 3. Decide what the fetch AUTHENTICATES with before writing it. The api key is
//!    not a given: Alibaba's reads inference only and every quota surface
//!    ignores it, so [`alibaba`] runs on a separate per-profile console session
//!    and its entries are collected even when the api key is absent
//!    ([`crate::usage::third_party_credentialed`] is the shared test, and the
//!    render layer reads the same one). A provider whose usage credential can
//!    die with no refresh path returns [`ThirdPartyError::AuthExpired`] rather
//!    than a generic failure, which is what stops the cadence and tells the
//!    operator to re-authenticate instead of waiting. The shared `get_json`
//!    already maps a 401 to it — a dead api key has no refresh path either — so
//!    a provider only needs to produce the verdict itself when the death
//!    arrives in an HTTP 200 body: Alibaba's session verdict and MiniMax's
//!    in-band dead-key codes.
//!
//! No render-layer changes needed — [`ThirdPartyStats`] carries provider-agnostic
//! [`UsageBar`]s (percentage windows) and [`StatRow`]s (text), which
//! [`crate::tui::render::usage`] renders uniformly. Unknown api-key providers go
//! through [`generic`]'s best-effort scanner, which sets `best_effort` so the UI
//! invites a bug report.
