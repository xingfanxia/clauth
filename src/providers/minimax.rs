//! MiniMax provider — Token Plan interval + weekly windows.
//!
//! One endpoint: `GET https://api.minimax.io/v1/token_plan/remains`, authorised
//! by the same api key the `/anthropic` completions endpoint takes. It answers
//! `model_remains[]` — one entry per plan bucket (`general` for text, `video`
//! for the video product), each carrying a rolling interval window and a weekly
//! one as REMAINING percentages plus their start and end instants in epoch-ms.
//!
//! Claude Code traffic bills against the `general` bucket, so that entry drives
//! the bars; every bucket is listed as a text row, since a reader picking this
//! account wants to see the whole plan. `video` shares the account but not the
//! window Claude Code spends, which is exactly why it must not become a bar.
//!
//! Only the international host is claimed. MiniMax also fronts a China-region
//! endpoint, but the typed fetch resolves its quota host from a constant rather
//! than from the profile's own `base_url` (see [`ThirdPartyTarget`]), so
//! claiming a second origin here would send one region's api key to the other
//! region's host. A CN account keeps falling through to the generic scanner
//! until that plumbing carries the base URL.
//!
//! [`ThirdPartyTarget`]: super::ThirdPartyTarget
