//! The codex credential engine: the `auth.json` model, the standby refresh
//! with codex's own discipline, and the last-known-good belt.
//!
//! Codex refresh tokens are SINGLE-USE rotating, and the server answers a
//! replay with `refresh_token_reused` — permanent, browser-re-login-only
//! (decision 7). Three rules fall out, and everything here serves one of
//! them:
//!
//! - **Single writer.** Every clauth-side rotation runs under the profile's
//!   [`RotationGuard`](crate::runtime::RotationGuard); codex-vs-codex is
//!   handled by codex's own reload-and-skip, clauth-vs-codex by the guard.
//! - **No replay.** A failed refresh persists nothing and the SAME token is
//!   never retried on the routine leg — a DURABLE memo (a fingerprint file
//!   beside the store) remembers the token a tick spent its shot on, so even
//!   a daemon restart, which forgets every in-memory map, does not re-send a
//!   token the server may have already consumed. Only the health kick
//!   (401-triggered) may retry past the memo, one forced attempt per kick and
//!   two consecutive kicks at most. A verdict the server calls terminal
//!   leaves a quarantine record beside the memo, bound to the token it
//!   judged, and every surface that would hand the chain to a session — the
//!   walk, the feed, start, switch — reads it for as long as that token is
//!   the one in the store: browser re-login is the only exit.
//! - **Stand down where a live carrier holds the chain.** Under real symlinks
//!   a live session reads the very file a rotation writes, so the only race is
//!   codex's own five-minute pre-expiry window; under the fake transport the
//!   session holds a SEPARATE copy, so any rotation desyncs it and clauth
//!   stands down for the whole live session. A PARKED profile has no carrier
//!   to defer to — waiting there is how chains die at the wham 401.
//!
//! The belt (accepted on #51): every well-formed read of the store records a
//! last-known-good copy — atomic, 0600, never linked from any home, so it can
//! never be a second carrier — and it is restored only after the store reads
//! bad continuously for a real wall-clock window (past any single codex
//! truncate+write) with NO live session, since a live session IS the writer.
//! Those two gates are what make it never-worse-than-nothing: a slow write is
//! never mistaken for a corrupt file, and its rotated pair is never stomped by
//! the pre-rotation belt. The residual window is a crash between codex's
//! truncate and its write of a newly rotated pair with no session live — the
//! belt then holds the superseded token, which fails exactly the way doing
//! nothing fails.
