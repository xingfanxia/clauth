//! `clauth herdr install`: the one command that sets the herdr plugin up.
//!
//! herdr owns plugin installation and prints its own preview of every command a
//! plugin would run before registering it, so this shells out with stdio
//! inherited rather than reimplementing that gate or silencing it. The half
//! herdr gives a plugin no way to declare is the reason a setup command exists
//! at all: a keybinding and a sidebar row template both live in the user's own
//! `config.toml`, so both were manual paste steps.
//!
//! Everything written into that config is validated by `herdr config check`
//! against a temporary copy first, which is what catches a `--key` herdr would
//! otherwise disable on load. The real write lands in place rather than through
//! a rename, so the file keeps the mode and inode herdr's config already has.
