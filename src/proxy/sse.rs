//! Terminal-event sniffer for the relayed SSE stream (proxy-design §1.8).
//!
//! The codex upstream does NOT reliably close the HTTP response after the
//! turn's final `response.completed` event — it can hold the stream open with
//! keepalives, while codex closes its own side the moment it has parsed the
//! terminal event. A relay that only stops on upstream EOF therefore lingers
//! on such turns until a write-to-a-dead-client fails or the agent backstop
//! timeout fires (the 2026-07-18 incident: one spurious "connection error"
//! per turn, plus thread pile-up toward the connection cap). The relay
//! instead sniffs the byte stream for the terminal event and closes both
//! sides once that event has been relayed IN FULL.
//!
//! Wire shape (captured live 2026-07-18, tee on a real turn): every event is
//! an `event: <name>` line, a `data: {"type":"<name>",...}` line, then a
//! blank line — and the terminal data line is HUGE (the entire response
//! object on one line, hundreds of KB). Two consequences the implementation
//! is built around:
//!
//! 1. A line is CLASSIFIED by its prefix as soon as enough bytes arrive —
//!    waiting for the newline of a several-hundred-KB line was the first
//!    sniffer bug (it never matched real turns).
//! 2. Classification only ARMS the sniffer; it FIRES at the next blank line
//!    (the SSE event terminator), so the terminal event's own bytes are
//!    fully relayed before the close. Firing on the prefix was the second
//!    sniffer bug (it truncated the completed event itself — reintroducing
//!    the exact "stream closed before response.completed" failure this
//!    module exists to prevent).
//!
//! Matching is LINE-ANCHORED: a pattern counts only at the start of an SSE
//! line. Model-generated text that literally contains "response.completed"
//! rides inside a delta payload's JSON string — mid-line, with any newline
//! escaped as `\n` (two bytes) — so it can never start a line and can never
//! false-trigger. A format drift upstream simply means no match: the relay
//! degrades to EOF/backstop behavior, never truncates.
