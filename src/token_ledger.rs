//! Durable per-day token ledger for the Tokens tab.
//!
//! # Why
//!
//! The tab's base is CC's `stats-cache.json`, authoritative only up to its
//! `lastComputedDate`; the [`crate::tokens`] top-up bridges the gap by reading
//! `~/.claude/projects/` transcripts strictly newer than that date. That bridge
//! is load-bearing precisely because the base can stay frozen for weeks — but CC
//! also prunes transcripts past `cleanupPeriodDays`. Once a day sits BOTH after a
//! frozen `lastComputedDate` and before the retention horizon, it lives in
//! neither source and is counted nowhere (the "shows too little" report).
//!
//! This ledger closes that hole: the first time a finalized (past) day is seen in
//! the transcripts, its per-model split is written to
//! `~/.clauth/token_ledger.json`, so the day's tokens survive the transcripts
//! being pruned. It doubles as a cold-start bound — the sweep's effective cutoff
//! advances to [`Ledger::recorded_through`], so a fresh process re-reads only days
//! after it instead of everything after a possibly-months-stale base date.
//!
//! # Boundaries
//!
//! - The ledger only ever records days strictly before "today" (a running day is
//!   incomplete). Recording inserts the first-seen split for each finalized
//!   day; the monotonic watermark makes each day record exactly once, so a
//!   later re-read can never lower or double-count a stored day.
//! - [`Ledger::apply_to_base`] folds only days strictly after the base's
//!   `lastComputedDate`, so if CC's own aggregation later catches up past a ledger
//!   day, the ledger never double-counts against the base.
//!
//! # Schema
//!
//! v2 adds per-hour buckets ([`WireModel::hours`]), optional on the wire: a v1
//! file (no `hours` key) loads with `None` and keeps `None` on save. A one-shot
//! backfill ([`Ledger::backfill_hours`], driven from the tokens worker) fills
//! those buckets from the transcript corpus where the stored flat totals still
//! match exactly; the `backfill_done` flag (absent → `false` in pre-backfill
//! files) makes that sweep run at most once per ledger. Days the corpus no
//! longer fully covers keep their v1 shape forever and price at the default
//! tier.
