/// ZWJ). None of them can reorder anything, and stripping ZWJ would shatter
/// every multi-person and profession emoji — `U+1F468 ZWJ U+1F469 ZWJ U+1F467`
/// is a family emoji, and a delegate emitting one is routine. They also carry
/// orthographic meaning inside real words in Persian and Hindi, which is the
/// rarer of the two cases.
///
/// Stripped BEFORE truncating, so the width bound counts what is actually
/// shown. `is_control` is the same predicate `herdr.rs` and `claude.rs` already
/// guard their own boundaries with.
///
/// **`--json` is deliberately NOT filtered, and it does not escape this class
/// either.** `serde_json` escapes below `0x20`, so a C0 byte comes back as
/// `\u0007`; every bidi character above it is emitted as its literal UTF-8

/// from the table. Measured, not assumed: an earlier version of this sentence
/// said `--json` "escapes rather than drops", which is true of C0 and false of
/// everything here.
///
/// Only the TAIL is filtered. The other columns are clauth-minted (`job_id`,
/// the state word, the figures) or roster-resolved (`profile`, which
/// `preflight_target` takes as an already-resolved account), so none of them
