# Publishes the clauth account a herdr pane burns as pane metadata, so a
# sidebar row can name it. Runs from the agent event hooks and from the
# `clauth.which` action, which is why it takes the pane from the injected
# context rather than an argument.
#
# herdr's process-info names the pane's own session in
# `foreground_process_group_id` — the `clauth start` supervisor for a
# clauth-started pane — and the live-session registry carries that pid, so
# the walk up the parent chain is the join. Delegate sessions share the pane:
# they run as children of its `clauth mcp` and their rows are keyed on their
# own processes, so the foreground chain resolves first and the compat sweep
# never matches through an mcp.
